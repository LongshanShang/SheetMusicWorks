I'll be the paint on the wall, I'll be the rain in the fall, I will be anything you want, my shutterbug. I'll be the clouds in blue skies, I'll be the green grass in paradise I will be anything you want, my shutterbug. I stay silent and keep my eyelids open, Tell me to sit up, Give me bumps on my skin Too shy to make advances, Stuck in your paper canvas, That's fine with me just let the dream begin...

Sirius	When we said goodbye. The world turned a darker shade. The dust settled down. Stones change color in the rain. But dark crowds they turn to white. Sunlight hit my skin I look top and saw a new beginning. Cause we came too far to gave up. We can take our time to start up new. We will be dancing thru the darkness. As long as we hold on to eachother.We'll be fine. We'll be fine. We'll be fine. Cause we came too far to gave up. We can take our time to start up new. We will be dancing thru the darkness. As long as we hold on to eachother.We'll be fine. You left me standing there. Lost in the haze. But I clipped my head. And realised you're walkin' away. I followed you and held you tight. Sunlight hit our skin. We look top and saw a new beginning. Cause we came too far to gave up. We can take our time to start up new. We will be dancing thru the darkness. As long as we hold on to eachother.We'll be fine. We'll be fine. We'll be fine. We'll be fine.	pos

Somebody That I Used To Know	Now and then I think of when we were together Like when you said you felt so happy you could die Told myself that you were right for me But felt so lonely in your company But that was love and it's an ache I still remember  You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness Like resignation to the end always the end So when we found that we could not make sense Well you said that we would still be friends But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough No,You didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know Now you're just somebody that I used to know  Now and then I think of all the times you screwed me over But had me believing it was always something that I'd done And I don't wanna live that way Reading into every word you say You said that you could let it go And I wouldn't catch you hung up on Somebody that you used to know But you didn't have to cut me off Make out like it never happened And that we were nothing And I don't even need your love But you treat me like a stranger And that feels so rough No,you didn't have to stoop so low Have your friends collect your records And then change your number I guess that I don't need that though Now you're just somebody that I used to know somebody I used to know	pos

Song for Lovers	Here’s a song for lovers Who don’t care if they don’t sleep If dragonflies with heavy hearts Cut the air like darts Here’s a song for lovers Who won’t ever have to weep Clear-sighted eyes and uncried tears All bright out in the sun You were far too young dear To get so close to the clouds No one told you to stay awake For pleasures of that kind You were far too small To step far outside of your house Now you saw how dragonflies Tint their hearts with dark Here’s a song for lovers Who don’t care if they bleed	pos

Star of the County Down	"Near Banbridge Town in the county down One morning last July, Down a bóithrín green came a sweet cailín And she smiled as she passed me by. From Bantry Bay up to Derry Ouay and From Galway to Dublin Town, No maid I've seen like the brown colleen That I met in the county down. She looked so sweet from her two bare feet To the sheen of her nut brown hair. Such a coaxing elf, sure I shook myself For to see I was really there. From Bantry Bay up to Derry Ouay and From Galway to Dublin Town, No maid I've seen like the brown colleen That I met in the county down. As she onward sped, sure I scratched my head, And I looked with a feelin' rare, And I say's, say's i, to a passer-by, ""whose the maid with the nut brown hair""? “ He smiled at me and he says's, say's he, ""she's the gem of Ireland's crown. “ Young rosie mccann from the banks of the bann, She's the star of the county down"". At the harvest fair she'll be surely there So I'll wear in my Sunday clothes, With my shoes shone bright and my hat cocked Right for a smile from my nut brown rose. No pipe I'll smoke, no horse I'll yoke Till my plough turns rust coloured brown. For a smiling bride, by my own fireside Sits the star of the county down. From Bantry bay up to Derry Ouay and From Galway to Dublin Town, No maid I've seen like the brown colleen That I met in the county down. From Bantry Bay up to Derry Ouay and From Galway to Dublin Town, No maid I've seen like the brown colleen That I met in the county down. "	pos

Stardust	Drowning in waves in the ocean of time, Giving up what has been mine, Well you’re the hardest to leave behind, I won’t question, I just unfold. I’ve seen it for how beautiful it’s been, I come apart, I’m going under… And then I feel only love, What’s been is gone and I’ll be one, One with the wind and the sky above, Til I become, til I become, And then I feel only love, What’s been is gone and I’ll be one, One with the wind and the sky above, Til I become, til I become… Stardust…  Out in the rays of the evening sun, Our story is never done, Fly over streets where we used to run, I’m still here, I hope you know… Thank you for how beautiful it’s been, I come apart, I’m going under. And then I feel only love, What’s been is gone and I’ll be one, One with the wind and the sky above, Til I become, til I become, And then I feel only love, What’s been is gone and I’ll be one, One with the wind and the sky above, Til I become, til I become… Stardust… Stardust… And then I feel only love, What’s been is gone and I’ll be one, One with the wind the sky above, Til I become, til I become… Stardust…	pos
Starfall	编曲：宫奇Gon  What is reflected in my eyes? Not the moonlight in a starless midnight that showers on the people passing by. One's so small and the world's so wide, every step forward echoes a sigh, I reach out for the halo far up high. Deeply engraved, my memory is silent but not forgotten indeed, someone has gone but a voice within me. Once I remember all the tales written inside this corp no more frail, I'll follow what my heart used to believe. Crash against the barrier above the crowd, Flaring up pieces in the air to show a fairy starfall. I want no tomorrow or yesterday. These sparkles shine and never fade till the break of day.

Staring At You	. Staring at you Staring at me It's a slow dance But I believe Mona Lisa Who do you see It's your one chance Do you believe . Let's get naked Under the knife We are dreamers Larger than life Staring at you Staring at me It's a slow dance But I believe . Lock up all the doors Better seal your heart up tight Block out all the noise But you can't escape the light Staring at you Staring at me . 'Cause your love creeps slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside You creep slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside . There's an ocean Inside of your head With all the words You wish you had said We are broken We have no pain You're the needle I am the vein . Lock up all the doors Gonna seal them out tonight  Block out all the noise 'Cause the only place that's right Is staring at you Staring at me . 'Cause your love creeps slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside You creep slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside Oh you hold it inside . Lock up all the doors Gonna seal them out tonight Block out all the noise 'Cause the only place that's right Is staring at you Staring at me . 'Cause your love creeps slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside You creep slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside You creep slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside You creep slow like a thief in the night You take my breath and you hold it inside Oh you hold it inside You hold it inside You hold it inside .	pos

Stay (Just a Little Bit More)	"He was a bore, a true chore and I still wonder why I ever wanted to see him more I know it is useless to complain all these years after, well... Thanks for asking now I'm fine I should have muffled my obsession but I was all too pure And so blindly sure that he'd always have the satisfying hug I needed Stay just a little bit more Don't let my heart turn sore Stay just a little bit more Don't let my heart turn sore He was kind, polite and divine in public, tender as a sleepy child But when we got slightly more intimate it wasn't that bright Yes he was kind, polite, sound and sublime, in theory But in practice believe me, there was a nasty fire burning Stay just a little bit more Don't let my heart turn sore Stay just a little bit more Don't let my heart turn sore And when my curves came into play Oh what a hopeles tumbling down When his desire was stuck in plaster I was young but I believed in no tales! Sit in the desert of the bed I looked hard for an oasis But all I could find was a dead camel in pieces And I got so scared I tried to lure him back to bed Whispered ""stay just a little bit more"" But now I'm grateful to the camel Because all the lazy boy could do was RUN, then I knew for sure That he would never be the satisfying shag I needed, no no no"	pos

Here comes the wind again Cold that cuts to the bone Pack my bags and I’ll head out the door Here I am on my own When I say how much more can I stand? I know my walls are falling down; I left the rocks and chose the sand And though I’ve no one left to blame Still, I cursed your name I cursed your name . So now the end What I’ve been running from Though I’ve tried I cannot lift my head Oh, what have I become? When I say how much more can I take? I know my time is running short, I am broken and I’ll break And though I’ve worn myself so thin I’m coming home again And though I do not know my heart Well, I know myself down to my bones, but if my bones should come apart Then I’ll have nothing left to give But if you take me in, I’m coming home again If you take me in I’m coming home again	pos

The Road Not Taken	Two roads diverged in a yellow wood I'd go back and rechoose if I could But here I lay now sick and so confused Was it all lie or was it all true Sleep now gently my darling love Don't let my worries trouble you People try hard to forget But memories will always stay Nightmares and dreams of long passed things Try and chase me away from sleep All that time I spent in the dark Just like that; I'm in the light; Everything will be fine Notice all the similarities We go together like the birds and bees Just imagine what all could have happened Every one I knew would long be dead What really goes on behind closed doors Makes me secretly cry out loud Within all these horror stories Lay many times of regret Always in such a frightened state Trapped in an imaginary cage Living my life day by day And soon enough; some day; I'll come out and play In a world where everything is upside down I try hard not to lose my mind Things keep getting worse so I tell myself everything will be fine I want to grow up and be a real bad cop In the end it'll work	pos
The Royal Wedding Song	"All of the girls around the world are saying the same thing I should - I should be the one to marry prince charming Now if this won't effect you then know we're feeling the same But listen up - I made this song and I’ll try to explain (check it out)  Every little girl has the same exact dream A pretty white dress and a (gasp) diamond ring To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell  To be the princess in his fairy tale Why is she the one that gets the fairy tale? This might make you laugh but its not a spoof Everything I raps 100% truth When a royal wedding happens... here's your proof Twinky sales go through the roof And the sorority girls all get excited But so much jealously... its hard to hide it All over the news and it hurts to look So one by one they tweet & face book Saying (uhh) such an issue I know girlfriend - pass me the tissues The boys I know all lack in sense And there she goes just... found a prince! ""real life princess"" must be nice That should be me... it's just not right It looks so sweet but it feels like a knife Well she's gonna have the perfect life Every little girl has the same exact dream A pretty white dress and a (gasp) diamond ring To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell  To be the princess in his fairy tale Why is she the one that gets the fairy tale? Now the hardest part is the honey moon More pictures then they can consume So the first 3 days they just stay in their rooms Back and forth - vent and fume and I don't really care... cause it's not my life But I mean... they ARE missing paradise So if you're a guy.... take my advise The best thing to do is just keep quiet Don't even try it... crackin' jokes Girls world wide just trying to cope See they had this dream... but they just lost hope Save yourselves... let 'em mope Cause they might seem cool... but there's major problems  Girly stuff.... trust we can't solve 'em Soon as they showed her in that tiara KNOW they ALL hit rock bottom Before I watch anymore... I'm going to need some diet coke and a tube of cookie dough!  Every little girl has the same exact dream A pretty white dress and a (gasp) diamond ring To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell  To be the princess in his fairy tale Every little girl has the same exact dream A pretty white dress and a (gasp) diamond ring To match the biggest wedding ever with a prince for show and tell  To be the princess in his fairy tale Not to worry ladies...

The Saltwater Room	I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light Walking down by the bay, on the shore, staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt Around my arms and began to shiver violently before You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me Running into the dark underground All the subways around create a great sound To my motion fatigue: farewell With your ear to a seashell You can hear the waves in underwater caves As if you actually were inside a saltwater room  Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home What will it take to make or break this hint of love? We need time, only time When we're apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? All the time, all the time Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on? All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow ~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~ Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt away home What will it take to make or break this hint of love? We need time, only time When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?

The Song (Bonus Track)	"A boy once roamed into the woods, His cheek was smooth and bright, He lost his way in woods of fay And was not home by night. The village folk turned out and searched From dawn till day was sped, But since they found no trace of him They gave him up as dead. Now after seven years had passed One morning it befell That he was seen beyond the green And heading toward the well. They asked him who he was and stared, His face seemed strange and dim. His parents both were gone and no One else remembered him. ""A while ago I lost the path And walked in woods of fay, I came in time to feast with them, But soon was sent away. The people there are white as snow And they have golden locks, These are their words for sun and moon, For valleys, hills, and brooks."" They laughed: ""This early in the day He can't be full of wine!"" They said that he was mad and made Him keeper of their kine. So every day he fared afield And sat upon a stone, And late into the night he sang, They left him quite alone. And only children heard his song And often sat beside, They sang it far into the years, Long after he had died."	pos

Please point me a way. so where can find my future? The neon light projecting on my face. As if I am in another world. Something's that flashed before my eyes. Is what I see is true? Fragments rush into my brain. I feel fidgety and empty. Is that tears in my eyelids. I will sleep forever now. The moment when the world disappears from my sight. My mechanical body is still working hard. Throat is hurting, I can't say anything. I still can't believe,is that the truth. The heartbeat is gradually accelerating. But my arms can't be lifted once again. I have always wanted to be reset. No way to retreat… Can someone tell me the truth please？ So where can find my future? Flash in my memory were you.

Sorting through what goes and what should stay Every stone I laid for you As if you had asked me to Monument to holy things Empty talk and circling Isn’t that we’re supposed to do What happens now? When all I’ve made is torn down What happens next? When all of you, is all that’s left This is the unmaking The beauty in the breaking Had to lose myself to find out who you are Before each beginning, there must be an ending Sitting in the rubble, I can see the stars This is the unmaking This is the unmaking The longer and the tighter that we hold Only makes it harder to le go But love will not stay locked inside The steeple or a tower high Only when we’re broken are we whole What happens now? When all I’ve made is torn down This is the unmaking The beauty in the breaking Had to lose myself to find out who you are Before each beginning, there must be an ending Sitting in the rubble, I can see the stars This is the unmaking This is the unmaking I’ll gather the same stones where Everything came crashing down I’ll build you an altar there on the same ground Cause what stood before was never yours This is the unmaking The beauty in the breaking Had to lose myself to find out who you are Before each beginning, there must be an ending Sitting in the rubble, I can see the stars This is the unmaking This is the unmaking Oh, this is the unmaking Had to lose myself to find out who you are	pos

The Way That We Are	In the blinded-eye parade, You're the only one I see. We have ventured far and wide, In the hope that you'll believe. That every waking day we find, Will reveal an open door. You turned my life around, But I don't need you anymore. We risked our lives on a feeling, It could all work out. Realize that you're wrong when you're leaving, And nothing you do could change it. Well maybe I could say what you say. If only I could do as you do. It's all in the way that we are; It will always be the reason we lose. I can feel the spring in your step. You'll never see the hole in my heart. But whatever you did, it carried me this far...  Well I could hide my love away, As we walk with head in hands. Every lesson learned could be the reason why you ran. And now your only hope is with The only friend you'll see. With friends as good as yours, There's no need for enemies. We risked our lives on a feeling, It could all work out. Realize that you're wrong when you're leaving, And nothing you do can change it. Well maybe I could say what you say. If only I could do as you do. It's all in the way that we are; It will always be the reason we lose. I can feel the spring in your step. You'll never see the hole in my heart. But whatever you did, it carried me this far...  We have fought in the pouring rain, Just to hide our tears. The only thing you gave to me, Is a feeling that I've lost years. Couldn't turn my days around, Of believing what you say. Without walking out...  We risked our lives on a feeling, It could all work out. Realize that you're wrong when you're leaving, And nothing you do can change it. Well maybe I could say what you say. If only I could do as you do. It's all in the way that we are; It will always be the reason we lose. I can feel the spring in your step. You'll never see the hole in my heart. But whatever you did, it carried me this far... Well maybe I could say what you say. If only I could do as you do. It's all in the way that we are; It will always be the reason we lose. I can feel the spring in your step. You'll never see the hole in my heart. But whatever you did, it carried me this far...	pos

Time (Official)	Time is the currency of your life, spend it wisely Don’t let others no matter how well intentioned spend it for you, it’s all you’ve got In the end, you may falter, but rest assured, time will not  Time is an endless, relentless stream, moving in one direction, while your memories move in another It is not something you choose, but rather, it is something that chooses you Ironically, it’s the timeless part of you that understands full well the true value of time Time, more than treasure, is the greatest gift you can give  It’s about time  It’s about time you do what you were put on earth to do It’s about time you let go of negative people and habits and move to higher ground It’s okay to waste time, but only on things you truly love and enjoy It’s much too precious to waste on anger and fear Remember time doesn’t change anything, it’s you that changes, everything We are all traveling through life at the same speed, sixty minutes per hour And if this is not the hour, when will be? When will you realize that this is the time of your life? The past is merely a dream and the future merely a prayer Your future starts right here, right now, not tomorrow The most important moment of your life is this one It’s about time 	pos

V Of Pelicans	Taken by the ocean and the wind Procession of broken pieces What's left now floating like a V of pelicans Captured by the slowly falling tide Scattered drift wood A doomed armada now crossing in search of the other side With the darkness eminent Everyone tries to find a way back home again Nothing but a frame of skin and bone She takes a deep breath to drown Or baptize this river with the tears she's never known A shadow of a wolf across the beach Silver and black a guardian Over the chasm that keeps us out of reach With the darkness eminent Everyone tries to find a way back home again Hidden in a single grain of sand A numinous charge of light A sudden unveiling with a chance to understand It doesn't matter now just what she wants The messages drift across horizons Half under like a flock of cormorants With the darkness eminent Everyone tries to find a way back home again Taken by the ocean and the wind Procession of broken pieces What's left now floating like a V of pelicans With the darkness eminent Everyone tries to find a way back home again. With the darkness eminent Everyone tries to find a way back home again.	pos

It's been a long time Since I last set eyes on the church with the steeple Down by the village green.  'Twas there I met a girl called Daisy And kissed her by the old oak tree.  Although I loved my Daisy, I saw fame, And so I left the village green. I miss the village green, And all the simple people. I miss the village green, The church, the clock, the steeple. I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school. And now all the houses Are rare antiquities. American tourists flock to see the village green.  They snap their photographs and say Gawd darn it, Isn't it a pretty scene?  And Daisy's married Tom the grocer boy, And now he owns a grocery. I miss the village green, And all the simple people. I miss the village green, The church, the clock, the steeple. I miss the morning dew, fresh air and Sunday school. And I will return there, And I'll see Daisy, And we'll sip tea, laugh, And talk about the village green.  We will laugh and talk about the village green.	pos
Vincent	Starry, starry night paint your palette blue and grey look out on a summer's day with eyes that know the darkness in my soul. Shadows on the hills sketch the trees and the daffodils catch the breeze and the winter chills in colors on the snowy linen land. And now I understand what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how you tried to set them free. They would not listen they did not know how perhaps they'll listen now. Starry starry night flaming flowers that brightly blaze swirling clouds in violet haze reflect in Vincent's eyes of china blue. Colors changing hue morning fields of amber grain weathered faces lined in pain are soothed beneath the artist's loving hand. And now I understand what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how you tried to set them free. They would not listen they did not know how perhaps they'll listen now. For they could not love you but still your love was true and when no hope was left inside on that. starry starry night You took your life as lovers often do, But I could have told you Vincent this world was never meant for one as beautiful as you. Starry starry night portraits hung in empty halls frameless heads on nameless walls with eyes that watch the world and can't forget. Like the strangers that you've met the ragged men in ragged clothes the silver thorn of bloody rose. lie crushed and broken on the virgin snow. And now I think I know what you tried to say to me and how you suffered for your sanity and how you tried to set them free. They would not listen they're not listening still perhaps they never will	pos
Vision	The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows It's a very mean and nasty place And I don't care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it You, me or nobody Is gonna hit as hard as life But it ain't about how hard you hit It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward, how much you can take, and keep moving foward. That's how we did to start it Now if you know what you're worth then go on and get what you're worth. But you gotta be willing to take the hits and not pointing fingers saying you ain't what you wanna be because of him, or her, or anybody. Cowards do that and that ain't you! You're better than that! The world ain't all sunshine and rainbows It will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it It's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward. That's how winning is done! You're better than that!	pos
Viva La Vida (Live)	I used to rule the world Seas would rise when I gave the word Now in the morning I sleep alone Sweep the streets I used to own I used to roll the dice Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes Listen as the crowd would sing: Now the old king is dead! Long live the king! One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castles stand Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain Once you go there was never, never an honest word That was when I ruled the world It was the wicked and wild wind Blew down the doors to let me in Shattered windows and the sound of drums People couldn't believe what I'd become Revolutionaries wait For my head on a silver plate Just a puppet on a lonely string Oh who would ever want to be king? I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing Roman Cavalry choirs are singing Be my mirror my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know Saint Peter will call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world Oooooh Oooooh Oooooh...

And you will try to hide and make it seem like it's nothin' But really you feel like everything is crashin' around you And you develop a problem in trustin' in other people Which later became an issue that will mentally pound you! You only get one life But every time you lookin' at yours you feel like all you ever see are mistakes And the problem and the reason you could never move forward in life Is because you were never awake Wake up You spend your life in a dream that you can't escape Cause you live your life in a coma, you're never awake Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up!

Walk Away	Looking back on younger days, the time has passed,  And nothing stays the same. Hey hey hey!   She was such a pretty girl, With glowing eyes and yellow curls. Hey hey hey!   Stars are in a summer night,  She's wishing that they'd fall down through the atmosphere, For a souvenir.  She's waiting for her Superman, her Never land,  Cause he can show the way. Hey hey hey!   Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing? A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  You better run away, run away, run away.  She's tellin' tales through telephone  That make you cry, chill to the bone. Hey hey hey!   It's lock and key, electrified,  Hide and seek from dirty eyes. Hey hey hey!   Driving in the rain to somewhere far,  But they've got tattoos stamped upon their arms, of her name in hearts  She doesn't understand that love is what you give, not given up.  Hey hey hey!   Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing?  A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  No matter what you say, what you say, what you say.

Wait! it's just about to break, it's more than I can take, Everything's about to change, I feel it in my veins, It's not going away, Everything's about to change.  This is a warning! like it or not!

Welcome To The Black Parade	"When I was a young boy My father took me into the city To see a marching band He said, ""Son when you grow up, Would you be the savior of the broken, The beaten and the damned?"" He said ""Will you defeat them, Your demons, and all the non-believers, The plans that they have made?"" ""Because one day I'll leave you, A phantom to lead you in the summer, To join The Black Parade."" When I was a young boy My father took me into the city To see a marching band He said, ""Son when you grow up, Would you be the savior of the broken, The beaten and the damned?""

We'll carry on, we'll carry on And though you're dead and gone believe me Your memory will carry on We'll carry on And though you're broken and defeated Your weary widow marches on Do or die, you'll never make me Because the world will never take my heart Go and try, you'll never break me We want it all, we wanna play this part We'll carry on ...

Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong Oh, I know I'm probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand Give you all his hours when he has the chance Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

If I gave it all to someone else instead  Would you pack your bags and get out of my head? Someday I won't even look around I'll stop wondering where are you now .

Winter Without You	Crowded rooms to numb the pain Coke & rum to erase the trace Of every thought you had of her Your friends all ask if you're ok You're dying now but wear a face It's not like you to be out late Hoping to find somebody anybody to better this When she's all you miss Why don't you pick up the phone and you tell her you love her Late like the fall but it's better than never for you you Cuz she's writing sad songs and each one's about you Keeping the memories but trying to forget too oh...  This winter's so cold alone Yesterday or years ago When the night leaves you all alone You keep her smile in your wallet And maybe it was what you said Or all the things left in your head You're fighting so hard to love again Hoping to find somebody anybody to better this When she's all you miss Why don't you pick up the phone and you tell her you love her Late like the fall but it's better than never For you you Cuz she's writing sad songs and each one's about you Keeping the memories but trying to forget too   This winter's so cold alone This winter's so cold alone	pos

You looked like an angel wearing that blouse We hit it off' i knew it was real But now i can't take all the pain that i feel Reach in your heart' i know i'm still there I don't wanna hear that you no longer care Remember the times? remember when we kissed? I didn't think you would ever do me like this I didn't think you'd wanna see me depressed I thought you'd be there for me' this i confess You said you were my best friend' was that a lie? Now i'm nothing to you' you're with another guy Y tried' i tried' i tried' and i'm trying Now on the inside it feels like i'm dying I need you and I miss you and I want you and I love you 'cause I wanna hold you I wanna kiss you You were my everything And i really miss you I need you and I miss you and I want you and I love you 'cause I wanna hold you I wanna kiss you You were my everything And i really miss you And i do miss you I just thought we were meant to be  I guess now' we'll never know  The only thing i want is for you to be happy  Whether it be with me' or without me  I just want you to be happy	pos

Shutterbug	I'll be the paint on the wall, I'll be the rain in the fall, I will be anything you want, my shutterbug. Snap a picture and capture all of my soul, Dim the lighting my lips are biting below, All your delicate touches, Your vision's making me blush with Precision making incisions in all that I know. I'll be the paint on the wall, I'll be the rain in the fall, I will be anything you want, my shutterbug. I'll be the clouds in blue skies, I'll be the green grass in paradise I will be anything you want, my shutterbug. I stay silent and keep my eyelids open, Tell me to sit up, Give me bumps on my skin Too shy to make advances, Stuck in your paper canvas, That's fine with me just let the dream begin... I'll be the paint on the wall, I'll be the rain in the fall, I will be anything you want, my shutterbug. I'll be the clouds in blue skies, I'll be the green grass in paradise I will be anything you want, my shutterbug.

Silhouette	Stood at the cold face, stood with our backs to the sun I can’t remember being nothing but fearless and young We’ve become echoes, but echoes that fade away We fall into the dark as we dive under the wave (I heard you say)  Devil’s on your shoulder Strangers in your head As if you don’t remember As if you can’t forget It’s only been a moment It’s only been a lifetime But tonight you’re a stranger Some silhouette  Let’s go out in flames so everyone knows who we are Cuz these city walls never knew that we’d make it this far We’ve become echoes, but echoes are fading away So let’s dance like two shadows burning out the glory day  Devil’s on your shoulder Strangers in your head As if you don’t remember As if you can’t forget It’s only been a moment It’s only been a lifetime But tonight you’re a stranger Some silhouette  Just hold me Just hold me Just hold me Just hold me  Devil’s on your shoulder Strangers in your head As if you don’t remember As if you can’t forget It’s only been a moment It’s only been a lifetime But tonight you’re a stranger Some silhouette  It’s only been a moment It’s only been a lifetime But tonight you’re a stranger Some silhouette  But tonight you’re a stranger Some silhouette 	neg
Silhouettes Of You	I light the fuse And I watch it burn And somewhere deep inside, I know there's a lesson to be learned It's not the crime but the way that we pay for Feelings are mutual  And you go upstairs And I hang my head Somebody said I let myself down as I crawled into bed I wondered why the hell I'd ever paid for Feelings are mutual  I'm tired of living in the shadow These paper walls, I can't break through I'm sick of standing by your window Tracing silhouettes of you But when it gets dark You light the spark And all the lies I try to live by start falling apart Whoever knew that it could be so painful Feelings are mutual Now I can't escape These things I've done But my anxieties have promised me the worst is to come So give up living for the life that you paid for Feelings are mutual I've won  I'm tired of living in the shadow These paper walls, I can't break through I'm sick of standing by your window  Tracing silhouettes of you Tracing silhouettes of you Tracing silhouettes of you Tracing silhouettes of you Tracing silhouettes of you  I light the fuse I watch it burn And somewhere deep inside, I know there's a lesson to be learned It's not the crime but the way that we pay feelings are mutual 	neg
Silver Linings	We were seeking silver linings diving far from the shore Sailing round the islands, diamonds scatter the floor Where we go?Where we go?Where we go? Didn't make a difference We were float we were float we were float up into the distance And even when the lights went down， down gold up in you The dizziest of heights, from the clouds tumbled down to you We were golden, living for the moment Swimming in slow motion Was it all a dream What we chosen blinded by emotions Nothing's what it seemed Was it all a dream, a dream Now I'm riding down a highway to a destination unknown I was certain for a while, but now I feel unsure I don't know, I don't know what will make a difference Growing old, growing old, shawty keep dreaming into existence And even when the lights fade out, down gold up in you The dizziest of heights, from the clouds tumbled down to you We were golden, living for the moment Swimming in slow motion Was it all a dream What we chosen blinded by emotions Nothing's what it seemed Was it all a dream, a dream 	neg

Song For a Lost Love	When the sun rises over the mountains And my tears turn the colour of gold Not even the blue of the ocean Can compare to the shade of my soul Every day, every night, I am crying For my loved one has gone away To faraway lands for the money Had he stayed we might all have died  Many days, many weeks, many months now And I haven't heard from him not a word The waves toss me back many rumors That my husband won't likely be back Then one morning in the dead of winter Wedged in the door a tattered old letter It must have been left by a sailor Who did good on a promise to honour  dearest wife dearest son dearest daughter I am writing with the shakiest of hands If you ever get this letter Then I never have made it to land When the sun rises over the mountains And my tears turn the colour of gold Not even the blue of the ocean Can compare to the shade of my soul Not even the blue of the ocean Can compare to the shade of my soul  	neg

What if you're not the same? You're meeting the different You're losing your spirit You don't know all the words you should say Those dams are behind us There's nothing else to do You throw out the memories That keep you remembering For you to go and start something new  'Cause even if your dream is failing Or feeling like you'll never sleep again There's nothing else that's more worth chasing Although we'll only meet now and again Whatever makes your heart beat faster Whatever gives you trouble through the night I won't forget the time we had when you came back And left your ruins all behind  If no one can hear you You're not too young to cry This emptiness swallowed us And let yourself get past And fall into this ocean of time	neg

Sound of Silence	"Hello darkness, my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains Within the sound of silence In restless dreams I walked alone Narrow streets of cobblestone Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked light I saw Ten thousand people, maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare disturb the sound of silence ""Fools"" said I, You do not know Silence like a cancer grows Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach to you But my words like silent raindrops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made. And the sign flashed out its warning And the words that it was forming And the sign said The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls And whispered in the sound of silence."	neg
Sound of Walking Away	I've been quiet aside you While my heart in my chest shouts Feeling silenced and lied to But enough is enough  Now don't come find me, I won't be here waiting I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying  Weren't listening me but now there's no way you won't hear There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid Hit play, hit play It's the sound of walking away  It's the sound of walking away It's the sound of walking away It's the sound of walking away  I've been drowning inside you While my love it just pours out I've been running behind you But enough is enough  Don't come find me, I won't be here waiting I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying  Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid Hit play, hit play It's the sound of walking away  It's the sound of walking away It's the sound of walking away 	neg

My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm out to be a father If I have a daughter, guess what I'm-a call her? I'm-a name her Bonnie.  I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some ***** who didn't wanthim. I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggestfan. I even got the underground **** that you did with Scam.  I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. I like the **** you did with Ruckus too, that **** was fat. Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.  My tea’s gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be grey， but   your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have the chance. I ain't mad, I just think it's ****** up you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert You didn't have to but you could have signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother, man. He's only 6 years old. We waited in the blistering cold for you for 4 hours and ya just said no. That's pretty ****ty man, you're like his ******' idol He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do.  I ain't that mad, but I just don't like bein' lied to. Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write you You would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way. I never knew my father neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.  I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs. So when I have a ****ty day, I drift away and put 'em on. Cause I don't really got **** else, so that **** help when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.  Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. It's like adrenaline. The Pain is such a sudden rush for me. See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does. She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up. You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, Stan. PS: We should be together too.  My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be grey, to put your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Mr. ""I'm too good to call or write my fans"" This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.  So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey Slim, ""I drank a fifth of vodka, ya dare me to drive?"" You know that song by Phil Collins from ""The Air In The Night""? About that guy who could have saved that other guy fromdrowning? But didn't? Then Phil saw it all then at his show he found him? That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me fromdrowning. Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy.  And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all o' your pictures off the wall. I love you Slim, we could have been together. Think about it. You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me. See Slim, shut up *****, I'm trying to talk Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you. 'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh ****, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this **** out?  screeching tires, crashing sounds, car splashes into thewater}  My tea's  gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that. And here's an autograph for your brother: I wrote it on your Starter cap.  I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you. Don't think I did that **** intentionally, just to diss you. And what's this **** you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that **** just clownin' dawg, c'mon, how ****** up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some.  And what's this **** about us meant to be together? That type of ****'ll make me not want us to meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin' just fine If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy ****. I seen this one **** on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who it was to Come to think about it...his name was...it was you.

Sutter's Mill	In the spring of forty-seven, So the story, it is told, Old john sutter went to the mill site Found a piece of shining gold. Well, he took it to the city Where the word, like wildfire, spread. And old john sutter soon came to wish he'd Left that stone in the river bed. For they came like herds of locusts Every woman, child and man In their lumbering conestogas They left their tracks upon the land. (chorus) Some would fail and some would prosper Some would die and some would kill Some would thank the lord for their deliverance And some would curse john sutter's mill. Well, they came from new york city, And they came from alabam' With their dreams of finding fortunes In this wild unsettled land. Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows As they tried to cross the plains. And some were lost in the rocky mountains With their hands froze to the reins. Oh... (chorus) Some would fail and some would prosper Some would die and some would kill Some would thank the lord for their deliverance And some would curse john sutter's mill. (music)  Well, some pushed on to california And others stopped to take their rest. And by the spring of eighteen-sixty They had opened up the west. And then the railroad came behind them And the land was plowed and tamed, When old john sutter went to meet his maker, He'd not one penny to his name. Oh... (chorus) Some would fail and some would prosper Some would die and some would kill Some would thank the lord for their deliverance And some would curse john sutter's mill. And some would curse john sutter's mill Some men's thirsts are never filled.	neg

The Failing Songs	As youths we used to talk at night Of the joys that life was going to bring our way And the failures of our forebears Were as clear to us as the cold light of day But now those days are dead and gone And the future that we had is now the past And it's cobwebs that we cling to Our aspirations turned to ashes in our hands	neg
The Flood	Here comes the flood again Watch it fall from the sky Feel it soak through my flesh and my blood Feel it burn in my eyes When I say how much more can I take? I know the water’s rising up, watch the waves crest and break And though I’ve made not but a sound I fear that I may drown I fear that I may drown . Here comes the wind again Cold that cuts to the bone Pack my bags and I’ll head out the door Here I am on my own When I say how much more can I stand? I know my walls are falling down; I left the rocks and chose the sand And though I’ve no one left to blame Still, I cursed your name I cursed your name . So now the end What I’ve been running from Though I’ve tried I cannot lift my head Oh, what have I become? When I say how much more can I take? I know my time is running short, I am broken and I’ll break And though I’ve worn myself so thin I’m coming home again And though I do not know my heart Well, I know myself down to my bones, but if my bones should come apart Then I’ll have nothing left to give But if you take me in, I’m coming home again If you take me in I’m coming home again	neg

The Love Song Of J. Alfred Prufrock (Soundtrack)	"Let us go then, you and I, When the evening is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a table; Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets, The muttering retreats Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells: Streets that follow like a tedious argument Of insidious intent To lead you to an overwhelming question ... Oh, do not ask, ""What is it?"" Let us go and make our visit. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes, The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes, Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening, Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains, Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys, Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap, And seeing that it was a soft October night, Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. And indeed there will be time For the yellow smoke that slides along the street, Rubbing its back upon the window-panes; There will be time, there will be time To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet; There will be time to murder and create, And time for all the works and days of hands That lift and drop a question on your plate; Time for you and time for me, And time yet for a hundred indecisions, And for a hundred visions and revisions, Before the taking of a toast and tea. In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo. And indeed there will be time To wonder, ""Do I dare?"" and, ""Do I dare?"" Time to turn back and descend the stair, With a bald spot in the middle of my hair— (They will say: ""How his hair is growing thin!"") My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin, My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin-- (They will say: ""But how his arms and legs are thin!"") Do I dare Disturb the universe? In a minute there is time For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse. For I have known them all already, known them all: Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons, I have measured out my life with coffee spoons; I know the voices dying with a dying fall Beneath the music from a farther room. So how should I presume? And I have known the eyes already, known them all— The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase, And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin, When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall, Then how should I begin To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways? And how should I presume? And I have known the arms already, known them all— Arms that are braceleted and white and bare (But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!) Is it perfume from a dress That makes me so digress? Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl. And should I then presume? And how should I begin? Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? ... I should have been a pair of ragged claws Scuttling across the floors of silent seas. And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully! Smoothed by long fingers, Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers, Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me. Should I, after tea and cakes and ices, Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis? But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed, Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter, I am no prophet—and here’s no great matter; I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid. And would it have been worth it, after all, After the cups, the marmalade, the tea, Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me, Would it have been worth while, To have bitten off the matter with a smile, To have squeezed the universe into a ball To roll it toward some overwhelming question, To say: ""I am Lazarus, come from the dead, Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all""— If one, settling a pillow by her head,   Should say: ""That is not what I meant at all;   That is not it, at all."" And would it have been worth it, after all, Would it have been worth while, After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets, After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor— And this, and so much more?— It is impossible to say just what I mean! But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen: Would it have been worth while If one, settling a pillow or throwing off a shawl, And turning toward the window, should say: ""That is not it at all, That is not what I meant, at all."" No I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be; Am an attendant lord, one that will do To swell a progress, start a scene or two, Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool, Deferential, glad to be of use, Politic, cautious, and meticulous; Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse; At times, indeed, almost ridiculous— Almost, at times, the Fool. I grow old ... I grow old ... I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each. I do not think that they will sing to me. I have seen them riding seaward on the waves Combing the white hair of the waves blown back When the wind blows the water white and black. We have lingered in the chambers of the sea By sea-girls wreathed with sea**** red and brown Till human voices wake us, and we drown."	neg

We need time, only time When we're apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? All the time, all the time Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on? All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow ~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~ Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt away home What will it take to make or break this hint of love?

The Sound of Silence	"Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains.Within the sound of silence ! In restless dreams I walk alone Narrow streets of cobble stone Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked night I saw Ten thousand people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare disturb the sound of silence. ""Fool"" said I ""you do not know Silence like a cancer grows."" Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent rain-drops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bow and prayed To the neon God they made And the sign flash out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sounds of silence"	neg

The Taste Of Tears	I know how things must change, How could they stay the same ? The pictures left the frame. It's too late to rearrange I know how things must change, For good. I tried so hard to be The one you dreamnt you'd see, Made a prison out of me, When you asked to be set free. I know how things must change, For good. The taste of tears, Long gone years, Spend perfect lies, To hypnotise. Now I watch how summers pass, The green fade in the grass, The candle burning fast. What did i think would last ? ？ I know how things must change, For good. I'd like to play the game, To call love by it's name, I'd live through it again, To lose and find you in. ， I know how things have changed, For good. The taste of tears, Long gone years, Spend perfect lies, To hypnotise. The taste of tears, Long gone years, Spend perfect lies, To hypnotise.	neg
The Touch	I wake up to a rainy morning, face a dreary day I turn the shower on and wash my blues away You wrap a towel around me with a smile that leaves no doubt And suddenly it dawns on me what life is all about It’s the touch of your heart; it’s a promise of a brand new start The intervention of love from heaven above It’s the magic of you, what a touch of your heart can do I can rise to the stars by the touch of your heart I see your arms before me even when you’re gone I hear you voice inside me, hear it calls like a song I feel you wrapped around me like a warm and sweet embrace And everywhere I look I see reflections of your face ‘Cause baby, you alone epitomise all that life can be And once again I realise you’re everything to me It’s the touch of your heart; it’s a promise of a brand new start The intervention of love from heaven above It’s the magic of you, what a touch of your heart can do I can rise to the stars by the touch of your heart I can rise to the stars by the touch of your heart	neg
The Tower	The one who survives by making the lives of others worthwhile She's coming apart right before my eyes The one who depends on the services she renders to those who come knocking She's seeing too clearly what she can't be What understanding defies she says I need not to need or else a love with intuition Someone who reaches out to my weakness and won't let go I need not to need I've always been the tower But now I feel like I'm the flowers trying to bloom in snow She turns off the light, anticipating night falling tenderly around her and watches the dusk The words won't come She carries the axe so convincingly, the fact is sometimes she believes it That she can be happy the way things are be happy with the things she's done And that I need not to need or else a love with intuition Someone who reaches out to my weakness and won't let go I need not to need I've always been the tower But now I feel like I'm the flowers trying to bloom in snow reach out hold back where is safety reach out and hold back Where is the one who can change me Where is the one The one a... a....a...  Reach out hold back where is safety reach out and hold back Where is the one who can save me Where is the one The one a...a...a... I need not to need or else a love with intuition Someone who reaches out to my weakness and won't let go I need not to need I've always been the tower But now I feel like I'm the flowers trying to bloom in snow I feel I like I'm the flowers trying to bloom in snow The danger and the power, The friend and the foe 	neg
The Wages Of An Easy Life	I wake up on the pavement still drunk I must have also been in some kind of fight this time.  I wish I was a character in a TV show then the only I'd worry about would be relationships.  How could you? Katie said you walked her all the way home through the snow last night.  But you never told her how you felt not even a year later when she got so sick and passed away on that cold Christmas day.  I work really hard at working too hard, I'll stay up till two like successful people do.  After the service we always have coffee and I always the only one standing by myself.  Because it's easier to suffer than it is to take responsibility.  I will find peace after a few drinks or when I am asleep.  So as I'm coughing blood it hits me that I may have always done my best to avoid the things I found hard.  I try to sit up and reach my cell phone but my heart stops and I stare up at the snow falling down.  Buried under soft white snow when carols fill the air angels we have heard on high.  Scott said life is hard, I know easy feels just like being dead.	neg

The Whereabouts of Love	In a room suffused with light I spend my hours waiting Waiting for the nightfall And I wonder if my life Is blissful or appalling If silence is my laughter  I hone my heart down to the bare bones Down to the pieces that are needed to survive And spend my life cruising on my own As I don’t care about the whereabouts of love The whereabouts of love  Is reclusiveness a curse Or could it be a blessing? A wall against disorder? While it shields me from the rain It causes me to dry out And counteracts my blooming I hone my heart down to the bare bones Down to the pieces that are needed to survive And spend my life cruising on my own As I don’t care about the whereabouts of love The whereabouts of love  …… I hone my heart down to the bare bones Down to the pieces that are needed to survive And spend my life cruising on my own As I don’t care about the whereabouts of love  The whereabouts of love  I hone my heart Someday I’ll I hone my heart Someday I’ll I hone my heart down to the bare bones I need to survive And spend my life cruising on my own Cruising on my own 	neg

Time (Official)	Time is the currency of your life, spend it wisely Don’t let others no matter how well intentioned spend it for you, it’s all you’ve got In the end, you may falter, but rest assured, time will not  Time is an endless, relentless stream, moving in one direction, while your memories move in another It is not something you choose, but rather, it is something that chooses you Ironically, it’s the timeless part of you that understands full well the true value of time Time, more than treasure, is the greatest gift you can give  It’s about time  It’s about time you do what you were put on earth to do It’s about time you let go of negative people and habits and move to higher ground It’s okay to waste time, but only on things you truly love and enjoy It’s much too precious to waste on anger and fear Remember time doesn’t change anything, it’s you that changes, everything We are all traveling through life at the same speed, sixty minutes per hour And if this is not the hour, when will be? When will you realize that this is the time of your life? The past is merely a dream and the future merely a prayer Your future starts right here, right now, not tomorrow The most important moment of your life is this one It’s about time 	neg

Walk Away	Looking back on younger days, the time has passed,  And nothing stays the same. Hey hey hey!   She was such a pretty girl, With glowing eyes and yellow curls. Hey hey hey!   Stars are in a summer night,  She's wishing that they'd fall down through the atmosphere, For a souvenir.  She's waiting for her Superman, her Never land,  Cause he can show the way. Hey hey hey!   Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing? A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  You better run away, run away, run away.  She's tellin' tales through telephone  That make you cry, chill to the bone. Hey hey hey!   It's lock and key, electrified,  Hide and seek from dirty eyes. Hey hey hey!   Driving in the rain to somewhere far,  But they've got tattoos stamped upon their arms, of her name in hearts  She doesn't understand that love is what you give, not given up.  Hey hey hey!   Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing?  A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  No matter what you say, what you say, what you say.  Yeah you better not sleep, because she's waiting, waiting. She knows all about you; you're in her aim.  A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  You better run away, run away, run away  A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  No matter what you say, what you say, what you say. 	neg
Walk on By	Run when the rhythms right Go into the night Go until you're out of sight And you're out of my mind Run when the rhythms right Go into the night Floating as the river flows Easy as it goes to the ocean So walk on by, I've got no reason to love you but I do, I do, I do You're showing me colors of the sky But all I see is grey You lost me when you lied Promise me but you never try Secrets in your eyes You go and run, I'll hide You're showing me colors of the sky But all I see is grey You lost me when you lied I don't ever wanna be crowned just another prize It breaks my heart Lost in the midnight blue shadows of the moon Here with open arms for you, feeling something so new Said with me you'd reach the sun Oh but we were so young Love me 'till the summer's done But keep me in your heart so i hold on So walk on by, I've got no reason to love you but I do, I do, I do You're showing me colors of the sky But all I see is grey You lost me when you lied Promise me but you never try Secrets in your eyes You go and run, I'll hide You're showing me colors of the sky But all I see is grey You lost me when you lied I don't ever wanna be crowned just another prize It breaks my heart Shook me to the ground now and some how I feel like you don't know me Shook me to the ground now I don't even know how Brought me to a life that you never showed me Coming from a locked up ghost of yourself But you're coming from the light There's more to you than you ever thought there was Yeah you're coming from the light Run when the rhythm's right	neg
Walk On Water	"I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes (****) Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set? My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as Soon as I grab, squeeze I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening I know the mark's high Butterflies rip apart my stomach Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with You're gonna harp, gripe, and That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these As pressure increases like khakis I feel the ice cracking, because I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water (****) But only when it freezes It's the curse of the standard That the first of the Mathers disc set Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect The delivery flawless And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark 'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart Like, ""This **** is garbage!"" God's given me all this Still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive And I try not to listen to nonsense But if you ******* are tryin' to strip me of my confidence Mission accomplished I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith And I'm not Prince, so I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes 'Cause I'm only human, just like you Making my mistakes, oh if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh It's true, I'm a Rubik's — a beautiful mess At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest A flawed human, I guess But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your Expectations and meet 'em, but first The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean He's goin' too fast Is he gonna shout or curse out his mom? There was a time I had the world by the balls Eatin' out my palm Every album song I was spazzin' the **** out on And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on But the only one who's looking down on me That matters now's DeShaun Am I lucky to be around this long? Begs the question though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home Is burnt to the ground And all that's left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And it's time to wash out the blonde Sales decline, the curtains drawn They're closin' the set I'm still pokin' my head from out behind And everyone who has doubt, remind Now take your best rhyme, outdo it Now do it a thousand times Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares Or gives a **** about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight, outta mind I might go outta mine 'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a ******' tightrope outta twine? But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'cause I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water But only when it freezes 'Cause I'm only human, just like you I've been making my mistakes, oh if you only knew I don't think you should believe in me the way that you do 'Cause I'm terrified to let you down, oh If I walked on water, I would drown 'Cause I'm just a man But as long as I got a mic, I'm godlike So me and you are not alike *****, I wrote ""Stan"""	neg

waves	Everything I do you say is beautiful Cut myself off everything unusual I’m sorry if I made you tear up once or twice Listen to your friends you know they’re always right  So take my heart once again Hold it like you’re innocent Take my life like it’s yours Don’t leave me here to watch it pour  We keep going like waves in motion I jump in your ocean again Stuck in the rhythm of blind devotion Dancing, broken till when?  Every time I leave you’re calling up my phone Asking me what time I think I will come home Suss me out but the feelings mutual Both to blame I’m willing to forget it all  So take my heart once again Hold it like you’re innocent Take my life like it’s yours Don’t leave me here to watch it pour  We keep going like waves in motion I jump in your ocean again Stuck in the rhythm of blind devotion Dancing, broken till when?  I don’t know what we’ve become You just say it’s all for fun Everyone tells me to run away Tried to ride the broken tides I took the lows you took the highs I clipped my wings so you could fly alone  We keep going like waves in motion I jump in your ocean again Stuck in the rhythm of blind devotion Dancing, broken till when?	neg

Winter Without You	Crowded rooms to numb the pain Coke & rum to erase the trace Of every thought you had of her Your friends all ask if you're ok You're dying now but wear a face It's not like you to be out late Hoping to find somebody anybody to better this When she's all you miss Why don't you pick up the phone and you tell her you love her Late like the fall but it's better than never for you you Cuz she's writing sad songs and each one's about you Keeping the memories but trying to forget too oh...  This winter's so cold alone Yesterday or years ago When the night leaves you all alone You keep her smile in your wallet And maybe it was what you said Or all the things left in your head You're fighting so hard to love again Hoping to find somebody anybody to better this When she's all you miss Why don't you pick up the phone and you tell her you love her Late like the fall but it's better than never For you you Cuz she's writing sad songs and each one's about you Keeping the memories but trying to forget too   This winter's so cold alone This winter's so cold alone	neg
Wish My Life Away	I never stood up very tall I think my voice was fairly small But there were times I'd wanna to shout Though my thoughts weren't sorted out So I'd stumble and I'd fall I learned to fly because of you So if you left, I could go too And everything you saw in me That's what I wanted to be Did I make it after all? All the grass on the other side Is it only greener in my mind? I'd still want it the same Because trading my yesterday Is to wish my life away As we dream and as we grow We have to learn to let things go But let the wonder never fade Though we've turned 10,000 pages Flying high or stuck below I've searched for meaning amidst doubt I've finally figured that part out And all the stories inside me Feels like I'm bursting at the seams And you're here after all All the grass on the other side Is it only greener in my mind? I'd still want it the same Because trading my yesterday Is to wish my life away	neg

Witchcraft	It's in your eyes, a color fade out Looks like a new transition The starting up and shaking your ground Turning your head to see a new day calling Does it feel like a head to lean on? A snapshot from where you were born I'm looking for your hand in the rough You're caught in the wire Well, I'll lift you out Leading on the action Caught in a cell phone's rays Bleeding on a sofa Staring at the waistline He's coming and she knows it Even though she knows why Footsteps in the hallway Girl, you haven't got time You gotta get out Go far away You gotta get out Go far away Darkness in the bedroom Maybe she is resting up Maybe she was out late Just come back from the club I can't hear her breathing Something doesn't seem right Killer in the hallway We're living on a set time We gotta get out Go far away we gotta get out Go far away	neg

Wrong (feat. Emilia Ali)	Ride Body on mine Gripping your waist as I was On the back of your bike Whipping round the corner Holding onto you, You never let me fall  Like that time You drove through the night When the distance killed me Looked me dead in the eyes Told me not to worry Holding onto you, I thought we had it all  But I was wrong I see it in your face from a mile away Feel it in my veins when you say her name My picture on your wall flipped the other way But still I stay  I know it's wrong I'm just a shadow in your sheets I don't belong Cause you're lying through your teeth, you got me Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, screaming out your name, Cause I like the pain I know it's wrong But it still feels right to me  Called An hour ago Left a message at the tone You should been home I bet you're probably not alone You really thought I didnt know? Cause you still hold My body so close Making promises you know You've already broke You say you'll love me and we'll stay Together til we're grey and old But your hearts so cold I see it in your face from a mile away, Feel it in my veins when you say her name, My picture on your wall flipped the other way But still I stay  I know it's wrong I'm just a shadow in your sheets I don't belong Cause you're lying through your teeth, You got me Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, Screaming out your name Cause I like the pain I know it's wrong But it still feels right to me  Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, screaming out your name Shackled in your chains, screaming out your name But it still feels right to me~	neg

Your Bones	In the spring we made a boat out of feathers, out of bones. We set fire to our homes, walking barefoot in the snow. Distant rhythm of the drum as we drifted towards the storm. Baby lion lost his teeth, now they're swimming in the sea.  Troubled spirits on my chest where they laid to rest. The birds all left my tall friend as your body hit the sand. Million stars up in the sky formed a tigers eye  that looked down on my face, out of time and out of place. So hold on,  hold on to what we are,  hold on to your heart.  Awaken by the sound of a screaming owl. Chasing leafs in the wind, going where we've never been. Said goodbye to you my friend, as the fire spread. All that's left are your bones that will soon sink like stones So hold on, hold on to what we are,  hold on to your heart.	neg
