Safe & Sound (from The Hunger Games Soundtrack)	"I remember tears streaming down your face, When I said I'll never let you go. When all those shadows almost killed your light, I remember, you said ""Don't leave me here alone."" But all that's dead and gone and past,tonight;  Just close your eyes, The sun is going down. You'll be alright, No one can hurt you now. Come morning light, You and I'll be safe and sound.  Don't you dare look out your window,darling, Everything's on fire The war outside our door keeps raging on. Hold on to this lullaby; Even when the music's gone.gone Just close your eyes, The sun is going down. You'll be alright, No one can hurt you now. Come morning light, You and I'll be safe and sound.  Just close your eyes, You'll be alright. Come morning light, You and I'll be safe and sound. "	1
Sailboats	Sailboats wish that they were stars Floating softly in the sky Among our dreams that bid goodbye Moving through transparent space Drifting through the stratosphere And onward 'till they disappear These continents' from overhead Look like tiny paper shapes Intricately set in place Below the misty mountain clouds There's a lovely silver bay Where sunset sailors often hide away Scuba diver in the lock Speedboat driver on the dock Sailplane pilot in the blue' take me up there with you The world looks brighter from this high altitude I was walking through the trees （Sailboats wish that they were stars） And I was swimming through the seas （'Cause they don't know who they are） I was falling through the air When it hit me right there My eyes are tired I don't even care An airplane carred me to bed Where I slept above the coast and dreamt I had become a ghost I sail above the frozen peaks Deep in cold cathedral caves Across the hills and far beyond the waves Take the car on the run Fly the jet to the sun And bring the spacecraft in soon While I play chess with the moon I feel like sleeping through this cold afternoon Once in 1964 Sailboats wish that they were stars An actress ran on the shore Cause they don't know who they are And though you'll never return I love you' Audrey Hepburn Sometimes I can see your face in the crowd There are sailboats throughout this brilliant sky But you cannot pick them out if you can't fly I'm glad the Earth doesn't care If I go up there If you want to' just ask me and I'll take you along	1

Scars To Your Beautiful	"She just wants to be beautiful She goes unnoticed, she knows no limits She craves attention, she praises an image She prays to be sculpted by the sculptor Oh, she don't see the light that's shining Deeper than the eyes can find it Maybe we have made her blind So she tries to cover up her pain and cut her woes away Cause covergirls don't cry after their face is made But there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful oh~ And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful She has dreams to be an envy, so she's starving You know, covergirls eat nothing She says ""beauty is pain and there's beauty in everything"" ""What's a little bit of hunger?"" ""I could go a little while longer,"" she fades away She don't see her perfect, she don't understand she's worth it Or that beauty goes deeper than the surface oh~ So to all the girls that's hurting Let me be your mirror, help you see a little bit clearer The light that shines within There's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful oh~ And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful No better you than the you that you are No better you than the you that you are No better life than the life we're living No better life than the life we're living No better time for your shine, you're a star No better time for your shine, you're a star Oh, you're beautiful, oh, you're beautiful And there's a hope that's waiting for you in the dark You should know you're beautiful just the way you are And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful And you don't have to change a thing The world could change its heart No scars to your beautiful, we're stars and we're beautiful "	1

Ship In The Sand	Woke up this morning thought, Gotta change my life I'm like a ship in the sand Just waiting for to die I got lot of reasons glad to be alive but always waking up alone just makes me wanna die. But always waking up alone, just makes me wanna die. I may be lonely but I'm not stupid I try to live with my mistake So I stay awake to ease all pain But I've never been very good at playing that game No I've never been very good at anything Forget the past it's just an ugly background That stains everything we try to believe in And accept the things that failed love brings And don't project it onto anyone else and don't project it onto anyone else	1

Somber (Acoustic)	You're a night sky getaway， You're the star that I can't replace， All the lights, but it's not the same， Without you, without you， Many miles, got nowhere to go， Pull the break on my merry go， Interstate, feeling all alone， Without you, without you， And I'm sure that my fingertips， Could be dancing upon your lips， It's a heaven I can't admit， And all upon in my head I'm questioning， Don't know if I'm ready for, ready for you， Don't know if I'm ready for, ready for you， Don't know if I'm ready for, ready for you， But I know I'm feeling somber and， I can't pull through, I can't pull， Yellow lights, unavailable， In the summer, I'm driving home， Feel the love's like a miracle， Is it true? Is it true? In the distance I see your face， I know it's right but I have my way， Understand that my heart won't break， Without you, without you， And I'm sure that my fingertips， Could be dancing upon your lips， It's a heaven I can't admit， And all upon in my head I'm questioning， Don't know if I'm ready for, ready for you， Don't know if I'm ready for, ready for you， Don't know if I'm ready for, ready for you， But I know I'm feeling somber and， I can't pull through, I can't pull， I know I'm feeling somber and, I can't pull through, Ready for ，ready for you, Let you know when I'm ready for you， Let you know when I'm ready for you， Let you know when I'm ready for you， Let you know when I'm ready for you， I let you know when I'm ready for you， I let you know when I'm ready for you， I let you know when I'm ready for you， So I'm ready for, ready for you I'm ready for, ready for you， I'm ready for, ready for you， I know I'm feeling somber and, I can't pull through, I'm ready for, ready for you， I'm ready for, ready for you， I'm ready for, ready for you， I'm ready for, I'm ready for you.	1

The Monster	I'm friends with the monster That's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me Stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy Yeah, you think I'm crazy (crazy) I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey Wanted to receive attention for my music Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated When I blew; see, but it was confusing 'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)

The Other Side	"I've got tired eyes A black sky Making it's home under my lash line You keep on crying Babe I don't mind I keep on staring at the clock trying to pass time In my life It flies by Faster than you could say, ""I love you, goodbye"" ""It's almost over"" You say with a sigh Will our lives be better when we make it to the other side? Ah, hope we make it to the other side Eighteen Prom queen We spend our time thinking 'bout what we'll be doing We walk quiet streets Not afraid of the sounds Nothing bad ever happens in this town Mean dreams Can't sleep Younger me thought this'd be more bittersweet But we never noticed how long it'd been Got too caught up in the life we're living Ah, hope we make it to the other side And I hope I hope All of our homes have white fences And I hope I hope Our smiles are wider than theirs is And I hope I hope All of our dreams are kept fragrant And I'll meet you on the pavement When we make it to the other side Ah, hope we make it to the other side "	1
The Other	Like a spotlight the water hits me Ran it extra cold to shake the words from my mouth Though I know that no one's listening I nervously rehearse for when you're around And I keep waiting like you might change my mind Who wrote the book on goodbye? There's never been a way to make this easy When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire Back and forth now I'm feelin' guilty Cause I just can't stop this pendulum in my head Though I know that our time is ending I'd rather lay forever right in this bed And I keep waiting like, you might change my mind Give me one more night Who wrote the book on goodbye? There's never been a way to make this easy When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire No one knows（know） No one knows（know） We fell from the peak And the stars, they broke their code I'm trying to forget How I landed on this road I'm caught in between What I wish and what I know When they say that you just know Who wrote the book on goodbye? There's never been a way to make this easy When there's nothing quite wrong but it don't feel right Either your head or your heart, you set the other on fire No one knows（know） No one knows（know） No one knows（know） You set the other on fire You set the other on fire You set the other on fire You set the other on fire You set the other on fire	1

The Problem	I call you don't wake up I guess I'll see you in the morning Is goodnight just goodbye You run I can't keep up How long can I keep holding on Until you're already gone Can I  call you mine Cause I don't have much left to give you Of my time Put down your phone You know it's been too long since We were alone Just being honest I want you bad Need you attention often And that's the problem Yeah I know that you're waiting on me Yeah I know that you're feeling lonely But I only have so much time And now I'm walking on a wire So torn I promise I'm not ignoring you And I take it personal when you say Can I  call you mine Cause I don't have much left to give you Of my time Put down your phone You know it's been too long since We were alone Just being honest I want you bad Need you attention often And that's the problem And that's the problem I hate car rides with instagram I wish that you would hold my hand I want to feel your lips again I hate car rides with instagram I wish that you would hold my hand I want to feel your lips again Put down your phone You know it's been too long since We were alone Just being honest I want you bad Need you attention often And that's the problem I hate car rides with instagram I wish that you would hold my hand I want to feel your lips again And that's the problem I hate car rides with instagram I wish that you would understand I want to feel your lips again And that's the problem	1
The Rain	Ever since the rain I’ve been waking on my own Left an empty space in a home we built to grow Watching waves at night I fell into the blue I guess I lost the light, now I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my, given all my love to you, you Ever since the rain I’ve been living days too slow Lie around and wait for a heart I used to know They say that over time there’ll be nothing left to lose But I still can’t find the light, I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my, given all my love to you, you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my, given all my love to you, you In the night when I’m dreaming Oh I know your body’s next to mine In the dark I can feel it Don’t you tell me I’m dreaming Won’t you stay with me? Won't you stay with me? Oh-oh Won't you stay with me? Won't you stay with me? Won't you stay? I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my, given all my love to you, you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my love to you I’ve given all my, given all my love to you, you	1
The River	I know a place where we can go To lay the troubles down eating your soul I know a place where mercy flows Take the stains make you whiter than snow Like a tide, it is rising up deep inside a current that moves and makes it come alive Living water that brings the dead to life, oh-oh-oh-oh We're going down to the river Down to the river, down to the river to pray Let's get washed by the water Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed) Let's go down, down, down to the river (Never the same) I've seen it move in my own life Took me from dusty roads into paradise All of my dirt, all of my shame Drowned in the streams that've made me born again Like a tide, it is rising up deep inside a current that moves and makes it come alive Living water that brings the dead to life, oh-oh-oh-oh We're going down to the river Down to the river, down to the river to pray Let's get washed by the water Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed) Let's go down, down, down to the river (Never the same) Let's go down We're going down to the river Down to the river, down to the river to pray Let's get washed by the water Washed by the water and rise up in amazing grace Let's go down, down, down to the river (You will leave changed) Let's go down, down, down to the river (Never the same) Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go in amazing grace	1
The Saltwater Room	I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light Walking down by the bay, on the shore, staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt Around my arms and began to shiver violently before You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me Running into the dark underground All the subways around create a great sound To my motion fatigue: farewell With your ear to a seashell You can hear the waves in underwater caves As if you actually were inside a saltwater room  Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt so at home What will it take to make or break this hint of love? We need time, only time When we're apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love? All the time, all the time Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on? All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow ~~So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love?~~ Time together is just never quite enough When you and I are alone, I’ve never felt away home What will it take to make or break this hint of love? We need time, only time When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of? If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone? So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love? All the time, all the time  Time together is just never quite enough When we’re apart whatever are you thinking of? What will it take to make or break this hint of love? So tell me darling, do you wish we’d fall in love? All the time	1
The Scientist	Come up to meet you Tell you I'm sorry You don't know how lovely you are I had to find you Tell you I need you Tell you I set you apart Tell me your secrets And ask me your questions Oh let's go back to the start Running in circles Coming up tails Heads on a science apart Nobody said it was easy It's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be this hard Oh take me back to the start I was just guessing At numbers and figures Pulling the puzzles apart Questions of science Science and progress Could not speak as loud as my heart But tell me you love me Come back and haunt me Oh and I rush to the start Running in circles chasing our tails Coming back as we are Nobody said it was easy Oh it's such a shame for us to part Nobody said it was easy No one ever said it would be so hard I'm going back to the start. Oh...	1
The Story Never Ends (Piano Version)	Stick, stick to your stones cause that's all you know I was caught in the middle I swallow my words down to the bone Cause nothing's that simple Late at night you pour it out Know that only brings you down But go ahead give me all the blame Yeah, twist my words and set them to flame, woah We all know That you'll go tell all of your friends That I'm the one you wish you never met And woah We all know The story never ends The story never ends Wound me like a toy spinning too fast In every direction How, how could I stay when you lit a match to all my intentions?

Time (Official)	Time is the currency of your life, spend it wisely Don’t let others no matter how well intentioned spend it for you, it’s all you’ve got In the end, you may falter, but rest assured, time will not  Time is an endless, relentless stream, moving in one direction, while your memories move in another It is not something you choose, but rather, it is something that chooses you Ironically, it’s the timeless part of you that understands full well the true value of time Time, more than treasure, is the greatest gift you can give  It’s about time  It’s about time you do what you were put on earth to do It’s about time you let go of negative people and habits and move to higher ground It’s okay to waste time, but only on things you truly love and enjoy It’s much too precious to waste on anger and fear Remember time doesn’t change anything, it’s you that changes, everything We are all traveling through life at the same speed, sixty minutes per hour And if this is not the hour, when will be? When will you realize that this is the time of your life? The past is merely a dream and the future merely a prayer Your future starts right here, right now, not tomorrow The most important moment of your life is this one It’s about time 	1
Time To Say Goodbye	When I am alone I sit and dream And when I dream the words are missing Yes, I know that in a room so full of light That all the light is missing But I don't see you with me, with me Close up the windows, bring the sun to my room Through the door you've opened Close, inside of me the light you see That you met in darkness Time to say goodbye Horizons are never far Would I have to find them alone without true light of my own? With you I will go On ships over seas That I now know No, they don't exist anymore It's time to say goodbye When you were so far away I sat alone and dreamt of the horizon Then I knew that you were here with me, with me Building bridges over land and sea Shine a blinding light for you and me To see, for us to be Time to say goodbye Horizons are never far Would I have to find them alone without true light of my own? With you I will go On ships over seas that I now know No, they don't exist anymore It's time to say goodbye	1

Walk Away	Looking back on younger days, the time has passed,  And nothing stays the same. Hey hey hey!   She was such a pretty girl, With glowing eyes and yellow curls. Hey hey hey!   Stars are in a summer night,  She's wishing that they'd fall down through the atmosphere, For a souvenir.  She's waiting for her Superman, her Never land,  Cause he can show the way. Hey hey hey!   Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing? A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  You better run away, run away, run away.  She's tellin' tales through telephone  That make you cry, chill to the bone. Hey hey hey!   It's lock and key, electrified,  Hide and seek from dirty eyes. Hey hey hey!   Driving in the rain to somewhere far,  But they've got tattoos stamped upon their arms, of her name in hearts  She doesn't understand that love is what you give, not given up.  Hey hey hey!   Where's her missing piece her mind's been chasing, chasing?  A bullet with your name, a ticking time grenade,  You better run away, run away, run away  Either way you're screwed, there's nothing you can do,  No matter what you say, what you say, what you say.  Yeah you better not sleep, because she's waiting, waiting. She knows all about you; you're in her aim.

Walls	 Ashes of nothing  That’s what you said  Was all that’s left of you  Stopped dreaming of running  Weight of the world  Has cast its chains on you   Yeah, you can’t wait just one more day  To make the sadness go away  Your heart’s a wire about to break  A sinking ship, your darkest day  So many lovers cast astray  But you’re a work of art, make no mistake  You’re broken, shattered, torn and frayed  But broken glass can be remade   So, let’s break down  These walls, walls around  Your soul pours out  Under all this broken ground  Lies a heart of steel   Lies a heart of steel   Ashes of nothing  That’s what you said  Was all that’s left of you  But still dreaming of something  From down below  The sky it seems so blue   So, let’s break down  These walls, walls around  Your soul pours out  Under all this broken ground  Lies a heart of steel   Under all this broken ground  Lies a heart of steel   Lies a heart of steel	1

Wanted	"She said that every time I close my eyes It feels like I could disappear I could overflow an ocean with the cavalcade of all my tears And I know I sound dramatic, but that's just how it feels She said I'm holdin' to the notion that I'll find something real And I just want to be wanted (Ooh) I could use a little love sometimes I just need to be needed (Ooh) Like to know I'm crossin' someone's mind I just want to be someone that somebody needs. I just want to be more than a drop in the sea. I just wanna be She said, ""I'm counting up my karma And I think it's time to cash it in. So tired of living in the shadow of a mountain Of what might have been. And I know I sound dramatic, but that's just how it feels. I've been looking for somebody to tell me that I'm real.""

Warm	While we lay in diamonds On a faraway island in a blissful silence You and I can, you and I can Fall in love, fall in love Fall in love All we got is a bag in the backseat And this love we share, not shabby at all But the fact is we moving too fast But the thought passed me When I got lost inside of your eyes Cliché to say but too true Picking up dandys You always wanted a dandy man you did Not a candy man I don't sugarcoat nothin' Extra cash come in handy Good thing we saved up extra Before we ran away from home We gotta go While we lay in diamonds On a faraway island in a blissful silence You and I can, you and I can Fall in love, fall in love Fall in love I know we got our love in the backseat That's where we met when I told you I can't meet it all Found out people cause I'm afraid they might say We have been tryin' take it all Moving fast but I wanna go faster Little afraid it'll be a disaster But I know that I don't wanna crash without you You're the one that makes me come alive I never thought it'd come to Something that was so new Something that was so true I can't let it go You hold no lies You speak what's on your mind You speak in different times You speak in my language, language The love and the anguish, anguish Forever and the end, the end But I don't wanna think about it Think about it, think about it Got the money and the time c'mon let's spend it Don't you pretend we ain't **** without it World ain't nothin' if we both ain't in it Holdin' hands so hold my hand Hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand When we're laying diamonds It's on a faraway island in a blissful silence You and I can, you and I can Fall in love, fall in love Fall in love Holding hands so hold my hand Hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand hold my hand Lay in diamonds Faraway island Blissful silence Fall in love Fall in love Fall in love Fall in love(and other background lyrics)	1

Tell me some new what you did like huh? Always looks like I just woke up Always looks like I’v had enough Medicine is good, yeh, I’m good, what’s up? Yeh, I said I’m good,Yeh~I’m great	1

Winter Song	Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum This is my winter song to you. The storm is coming soon, It rolls in from the sea My voice; a beacon in the night. My words will be your light, To carry you to me. Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love They say that things just cannot grow Beneath the winter snow, Or so I have been told. They say we're buried far, Just like a distant star I simply cannot hold. Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? This is my winter song. December never felt so wrong, Cause you're not where you belong; Inside my arms. Bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum Bum bum bum bum bum bum I still believe in summer days. The seasons always change And life will find a way. I'll be your harvester of light And send it out tonight So we can start again. Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? This is my winter song. December never felt so wrong, Cause you're not where you belong; Inside my arms. This is my winter song to you. The storm is coming soon It rolls in from the sea. My love a beacon in the night. My words will be your light To carry you to me. Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive? Is love alive?	1
Winter Without You	Crowded rooms to numb the pain Coke & rum to erase the trace Of every thought you had of her Your friends all ask if you're ok You're dying now but wear a face It's not like you to be out late Hoping to find somebody anybody to better this When she's all you miss Why don't you pick up the phone and you tell her you love her Late like the fall but it's better than never for you you Cuz she's writing sad songs and each one's about you Keeping the memories but trying to forget too oh...  This winter's so cold alone Yesterday or years ago When the night leaves you all alone You keep her smile in your wallet And maybe it was what you said Or all the things left in your head You're fighting so hard to love again Hoping to find somebody anybody to better this When she's all you miss Why don't you pick up the phone and you tell her you love her Late like the fall but it's better than never For you you Cuz she's writing sad songs and each one's about you Keeping the memories but trying to forget too   This winter's so cold alone This winter's so cold alone	1

Is there a 12 step just for you? Our conversation's all in blue 11 ""heys"" (Hey, hey, hey, hey) Ten fingers tearing out my hair Nine times you never made it there I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away (Yay) How am I supposed to make you feel okay When all you do is walk the other way? I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay I just kinda wish you were gay To spare my pride To give your lack of interest an explanation Don't say I'm not your type Just say that I'm not your preferred ***ual orientation I'm so selfish But you make me feel helpless, yeah And I can't stand another day Stand another day I just wanna make you feel okay But all you do is look the other way I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay I just kinda wish you were gay I just kinda wish you were gay I just kinda wish you were gay "	1
Without Me (ILLENIUM Remix)	Found you when your heart was broke I filled your cup until it overflowed Took it so far to keep you close I was afraid to leave you on your own  I said I'd catch you if you fall And if they laugh, then **** 'em all And then I got you off your knees Put you right back on your feet Just so you could take advantage of me  Tell me how's it feel, sittin' up there?

Thinking you could live without me Thinking you could live without me Baby, I'm the one who put you up there I don't know why (Yeah, I don't know why) Thinking you could  Gave love 'bout a hundred tries Just running from the demons in your mind Then I took yours and made 'em mine I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind  Said I'd catch you if you fall And if they laugh, then **** 'em all And then I got you off your knees Put you right back on your feet Just so you could take advantage of me  Tell me how's it feel, sittin' up there?

Wrong (feat. Emilia Ali)	Ride Body on mine Gripping your waist as I was On the back of your bike Whipping round the corner Holding onto you, You never let me fall  Like that time You drove through the night When the distance killed me Looked me dead in the eyes Told me not to worry Holding onto you, I thought we had it all  But I was wrong I see it in your face from a mile away Feel it in my veins when you say her name My picture on your wall flipped the other way But still I stay  I know it's wrong I'm just a shadow in your sheets I don't belong Cause you're lying through your teeth, you got me Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, screaming out your name, Cause I like the pain I know it's wrong But it still feels right to me  Called An hour ago Left a message at the tone You should been home I bet you're probably not alone You really thought I didnt know? Cause you still hold My body so close Making promises you know You've already broke You say you'll love me and we'll stay Together til we're grey and old But your hearts so cold I see it in your face from a mile away, Feel it in my veins when you say her name, My picture on your wall flipped the other way But still I stay  I know it's wrong I'm just a shadow in your sheets I don't belong Cause you're lying through your teeth, You got me Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, Screaming out your name Cause I like the pain I know it's wrong But it still feels right to me  Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, screaming out your name Shackled in your chains, screaming out your name But it still feels right to me~	1

Set Sail	They say love is an island Beautiful at a distance Some are trying to find it Some are trying to find a way out You've been on both sides Of these rough waters Somehow you survived But you came out on your own And you still need someone  Will you set sail Will you set sail tonight Till we see land Never look back or behind I don't know if we'll get lost at sea Or we'll end up where we're supposed to be Are you brave enough to swim against the tide Ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh ohh...  Love leaves you stranded But that's the way we want it Save in our own refuge No one else will ever reach it Will you be that someone Will you set sail Will you set sail tonight Till we see land Never look back or behind I don't know if we'll get lost at sea Or we will end up where we are supposed to be Are you brave enough to swim against the tide  Any breaking wave can lead you home Or turn you upside down and leave you here There's no one here to hurt you But no one there to save you Will you risk it all Will you set sail Will you set sail tonight Till we see land Never look back or behind I don't know if we will get lost at sea Or we'll end up where we're supposed to be Are you brave enough to swim against the tide	0
Shadow of Doubt	歌曲：Shadow of Doubt 歌手：Melanie Penn 所属专辑：Hope Tonight  When the sun goes in When the sun goes out When the moon rises and the ocean is high It seems like we’re gonna drown And if I don’t feel then The way that I do now If there’s a shadow of doubt  I swear I won’t give in If ever questions begin No I won’t flee if I’m faced With a moment of certainty I’ll remember then What I’m tellin ya now If there’s a shadow of doubt  Human nature is a fickle thing Filled with weary self invention I’m fully-grown I know my soul is prone to wandering So if ever I should lose my way Maybe then I’ll know what love is If the feelings fade, I promise I will stay And live it out  So if a midnight comes If a fire grows cold If a heart that once held a spark Becomes harder than stone Oh I will stand by you And see the season through Beyond the shadow of doubt  Human nature is a fickle thing Filled with weary self invention I’m fully-grown I know my soul is prone to wandering So if ever I should lose my way Maybe then I’ll know what love is If the feelings fade, I promise I will stay And live it out I will live it out I will live this out Beyond the shadow of doubt No doubt Beyond the shadow of doubt Don’t dare me Beyond the shadow of doubt	0

Shane	So I told you all,  ‘Don’t try it again.’ You might think it’s small.  Until he rides it in. Like Shane, he comes when you need him. Then off to the dusty trails.  You know it’s a season, and he can’t go home. Sometimes it don’t make sense.  It’s best to leave it alone.  It makes me feel real small that he controls the winds. Like Shane, he comes when you need him.  Then off to the dusty trails. You know it’s a season, and he can’t go home. This ride seems long to me.  It’s not so far. This ride seems long to me.  It’s not so far. Like Shane, he comes when you need him.  Then off to the dusty trails. You know it’s a season, and he can’t go home. it’s a season, and he can’t go home.	0
Shape Of My Heart	 He deals the cards as a meditation And those he plays never suspect He doesn't play for the money he wins He doesn't play for respect He deals the cards to find the answer The sacred geometry of chance The hidden law of a probable outcome The numbers lead a dance I know that the spades are swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart He may play the jack of diamonds He may lay the queen of spades He may conseal a king in his hand While the memory of it fades I know that the spades are swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that the diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart But that's not the shape, shape of my heart  And if i told you that i loved you You'd maybe think there's something wrong I'm not a man of too many faces The mask i wear is one Those who speak know nothing And find out to their cost Like those who curse their luck in too many places Are those who fear a lost I know that the spades are swords of a soldier I know that the clubs are weapons of war I know that diamonds mean money for this art But that's not the shape of my heart But that's not the shape of my heart Thats not the shape, shape of my heart 	0

Silver Linings	We were seeking silver linings diving far from the shore Sailing round the islands, diamonds scatter the floor Where we go?Where we go?Where we go? Didn't make a difference We were float we were float we were float up into the distance And even when the lights went down， down gold up in you The dizziest of heights, from the clouds tumbled down to you We were golden, living for the moment Swimming in slow motion Was it all a dream What we chosen blinded by emotions Nothing's what it seemed Was it all a dream, a dream Now I'm riding down a highway to a destination unknown I was certain for a while, but now I feel unsure I don't know, I don't know what will make a difference Growing old, growing old, shawty keep dreaming into existence And even when the lights fade out, down gold up in you The dizziest of heights, from the clouds tumbled down to you We were golden, living for the moment Swimming in slow motion Was it all a dream What we chosen blinded by emotions Nothing's what it seemed Was it all a dream, a dream 	0

Six Feet Under	Help, I lost myself again But I remember you Don't come back, it won't end well But I wish you'd tell me to Our love is six feet under I can't help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Would roses bloom Could roses bloom Again  Retrace my lips Erase your touch It's all too much for me Blow away, like smoke in air How can you die carelessly? Our love is six feet under I can't help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Would roses bloom Could roses bloom They're playing our sound Laying us down tonight And all of these clouds crying us back to life But you're cold as a knife Six feet under I can't help but wonder If our grave was watered by the rain Bloom Bloom Again Help, I lost myself again But I remember you	0
Sketch Plane	Sittin' here, breathing deeply, ****ing  ready to go Been standing here blankly for an hour, can't say goodbye or hello It's like solitary confinement, just need someone to hold I'm not as brave as I'm portrayed, I need to be told to be bold Comin' in hot, I'm alone, no support Packed my bags, said hello to the airport I hope they board up my room and keep it empty Because fillin' my space ain't that damn easy My frontier awaits, I'm a soldier trekking solo Leaving all the past **** down below Movin' out, I've grown from a seed to a tree Gunna miss my friends and my family Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane I've got nothing left to say Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane I've got nothing left to say Grabbing ahold of my memories, tucking them away in my pocket I'll be the holder of the key to your heart shaped locket Now I know the pain remains but you gotta know I'm gunna return I'm like a dog run away from my home but there's a trail that's been burned for me to follow Back to you, to your arms, to your heart, to your soul I'll be bleeding from the inside out through your empty hole I'm scared as hell, to go out on my own You can wait by the door, by the window, until the day I come home Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane I've got nothing left to say Taking off in the rain on a sketch plane Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane I've got nothing left to say Bridge I've got my ticket to click it Stick it out to the end Start the engine, leave my vengeance outside on the land I've got my ticket to click it Stick it out to the end Start the engine, leave my vengeance, got a new life to begin Taking off from the rain in a sketch plane Don't know where I'm going but I feel the pain Taking off from the pain in a sketch plane I've got nothing left to say No matter how far I go, I will never leave you I've got to show that I can flow like a pro in a different state and home Keep your feet on your track I'll keep my mind in line with the time And we'll be happy, living together and free in the blink of an eye I'm as content as I've ever been Not trippin' or slippin' I've been livin' life to the fullest, it's love I've been grippin' It's so strong I could leave for years and come back And nothing will have changed, except I'll be on your track	0

Stan	"My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Slim, I wrote you but you still ain't callin' I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom I sent two letters back in autumn You must not have got 'em There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'  Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em But anyways, **** it, what's been up man, how's your daughter? My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm out to be a father If I have a daughter, guess what I'm-a call her? I'm-a name her Bonnie.  I read about your uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry I had a friend kill himself over some ***** who didn't wanthim. I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggestfan. I even got the underground **** that you did with Scam.  I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man. I like the **** you did with Ruckus too, that **** was fat. Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.  My tea’s gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be grey， but   your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have the chance. I ain't mad, I just think it's ****** up you don't answer fans. If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert You didn't have to but you could have signed an autograph for Matthew. That's my little brother, man. He's only 6 years old. We waited in the blistering cold for you for 4 hours and ya just said no. That's pretty ****ty man, you're like his ******' idol He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do.  I ain't that mad, but I just don't like bein' lied to. Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I write you You would write back. See, I'm just like you in a way. I never knew my father neither. He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her.  I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs. So when I have a ****ty day, I drift away and put 'em on. Cause I don't really got **** else, so that **** help when I'm depressed. I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest.  Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds. It's like adrenaline. The Pain is such a sudden rush for me. See, everything you say is real, and I respect you 'cause you tell it. My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7. But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does. She don't know what it was like for people like us growing up. You've gotta call me man. I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose. Sincerely yours, Stan. PS: We should be together too.  My tea's gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be grey, to put your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Mr. ""I'm too good to call or write my fans"" This'll be the last package I ever send your ass. It's been six months and still no word. I don't deserve it? I know you got my last two letters, I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect.  So this is my cassette I'm sending you. I hope you hear it. I'm in the car right now. I'm doing 90 on the freeway. Hey Slim, ""I drank a fifth of vodka, ya dare me to drive?"" You know that song by Phil Collins from ""The Air In The Night""? About that guy who could have saved that other guy fromdrowning? But didn't? Then Phil saw it all then at his show he found him? That's kinda how this is. You could have rescued me fromdrowning. Now it's too late. I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy.  And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call. I hope you know I ripped all o' your pictures off the wall. I love you Slim, we could have been together. Think about it. You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it. And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it. I hope your conscious eats at you and you can't breathe without me. See Slim, shut up *****, I'm trying to talk Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screaming in the trunk. But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you. 'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too. Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now. Oh ****, I forgot, how am I supposed to send this **** out?  screeching tires, crashing sounds, car splashes into thewater}  My tea's  gone cold, I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all the morning rain clouds up my window and I can't see at all And even if I could it'd all be gray, but your picture on my wall it reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad  Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner, but I've just been busy. You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she? Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that. And here's an autograph for your brother: I wrote it on your Starter cap.  I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I must have missed you. Don't think I did that **** intentionally, just to diss you. And what's this **** you said about you like to cut your wrists too? I say that **** just clownin' dawg, c'mon, how ****** up is you? You got some issues, Stan, I think you need some counselin' To help your ass from bouncin' off the walls when you get down some.  And what's this **** about us meant to be together? That type of ****'ll make me not want us to meet each other. I really think you and your girlfriend need each other. Or maybe you just need to treat her better. I hope you get to read this letter. I just hope it reaches you in time. Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'd be doin' just fine If you'd relax a little. I'm glad that I inspire you, but Stan Why are you so mad? Try to understand that I do want you as a fan. I just don't want you to do some crazy ****. I seen this one **** on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick. Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid And in the car they found a tape but it didn't say who it was to Come to think about it...his name was...it was you. Damn.  "	0

Sutter's Mill	In the spring of forty-seven, So the story, it is told, Old john sutter went to the mill site Found a piece of shining gold. Well, he took it to the city Where the word, like wildfire, spread. And old john sutter soon came to wish he'd Left that stone in the river bed. For they came like herds of locusts Every woman, child and man In their lumbering conestogas They left their tracks upon the land. (chorus) Some would fail and some would prosper Some would die and some would kill Some would thank the lord for their deliverance And some would curse john sutter's mill. Well, they came from new york city, And they came from alabam' With their dreams of finding fortunes In this wild unsettled land. Well, some fell prey to hostile arrows As they tried to cross the plains. And some were lost in the rocky mountains With their hands froze to the reins. Oh... (chorus) Some would fail and some would prosper Some would die and some would kill Some would thank the lord for their deliverance And some would curse john sutter's mill. (music)  Well, some pushed on to california And others stopped to take their rest. And by the spring of eighteen-sixty They had opened up the west. And then the railroad came behind them And the land was plowed and tamed, When old john sutter went to meet his maker, He'd not one penny to his name. Oh... (chorus) Some would fail and some would prosper Some would die and some would kill Some would thank the lord for their deliverance And some would curse john sutter's mill. And some would curse john sutter's mill Some men's thirsts are never filled.	0

The Sound Of Silence	"Hello darkness my old friend I've come to talk with you again Because a vision softly creeping Left its seeds while I was sleeping And the vision that was planted in my brain Still remains.Within the sound of silence ! In restless dreams I walk alone Narrow streets of cobble stone Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damp When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light That split the night And touched the sound of silence And in the naked night I saw Ten thousand people maybe more People talking without speaking People hearing without listening People writing songs that voices never share And no one dare disturb the sound of silence. ""Fool"" said I ""you do not know Silence like a cancer grows."" Hear my words that I might teach you Take my arms that I might reach you But my words like silent rain-drops fell And echoed in the wells of silence And the people bow and prayed To the neon God they made And the sign flash out its warning In the words that it was forming And the sign said The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls And tenement halls And whispered in the sounds of silence"	0
The Taste Of Tears	I know how things must change, How could they stay the same ? The pictures left the frame. It's too late to rearrange I know how things must change, For good. I tried so hard to be The one you dreamnt you'd see, Made a prison out of me, When you asked to be set free. I know how things must change, For good. The taste of tears, Long gone years, Spend perfect lies, To hypnotise. Now I watch how summers pass, The green fade in the grass, The candle burning fast. What did i think would last ? ？ I know how things must change, For good. I'd like to play the game, To call love by it's name, I'd live through it again, To lose and find you in. ， I know how things have changed, For good. The taste of tears, Long gone years, Spend perfect lies, To hypnotise. The taste of tears, Long gone years, Spend perfect lies, To hypnotise.	0

The Crying Solo	Here I stand, all alone My love is gone and all he left to me were broken memories I can still feel the breeze of his perfume, my nights are endless now that he’s not in my arms Cause after all we’re alone in our lives I must learn to conceal with myself Can someone fix my broken heart and help me start life all over now that I care I’m crying solo venting my sorrow I’m trying to forget the world that we had ahead The hours don’t run when you’re sad and lonely and gravity feels more and more in my space I’m crying solo venting my sorrow I’m trying to forget the world that we had ahead The answer to the pain is to let it find you in order to feel strong for whatever is coming ...... Breathe, go out, take a walk It's time to fall in love with life and with what I really am Cause after all we’re alone in our lives I must learn to conceal with myself Can someone fix my broken heart and help me start life all over now that I care I’m crying solo venting my sorrow I’m trying to forget the world that we had ahead The hours don’t run when you’re sad and lonely and gravity feels more and more in my space I’m crying solo venting my sorrow I’m trying to forget the world that we had ahead The answer to the pain is to let it find you in order to feel strong for whatever is coming ...... See, the flowers always bloom trees grow to the moon they look beautiful Makes no sense at all to see everything gray while there are so many colors in my head I’m crying solo venting my sorrow I’m trying to forget the world that we had ahead The answer to the pain is to let it find you in order to feel strong for whatever is coming	0

Time (Official)	Time is the currency of your life, spend it wisely Don’t let others no matter how well intentioned spend it for you, it’s all you’ve got In the end, you may falter, but rest assured, time will not  Time is an endless, relentless stream, moving in one direction, while your memories move in another It is not something you choose, but rather, it is something that chooses you Ironically, it’s the timeless part of you that understands full well the true value of time Time, more than treasure, is the greatest gift you can give  It’s about time  It’s about time you do what you were put on earth to do It’s about time you let go of negative people and habits and move to higher ground It’s okay to waste time, but only on things you truly love and enjoy It’s much too precious to waste on anger and fear Remember time doesn’t change anything, it’s you that changes, everything We are all traveling through life at the same speed, sixty minutes per hour And if this is not the hour, when will be? When will you realize that this is the time of your life? The past is merely a dream and the future merely a prayer Your future starts right here, right now, not tomorrow The most important moment of your life is this one It’s about time 	0

My pride, my ego, my needs and my selfish ways Caused a good strong woman like you to walk out my life Now I never, never get to clean up the mess I made And it haunts me every time I close my eyes It all just sounds like uh, uh, uh, uh Too young, too dumb to realize That I should have bought you flowers and held your hand Should have gave you all my hours when I had the chance Take you to every party cause all you wanted to do was dance Now my baby is dancing, but she's dancing with another man. Although it hurts I'll be the first to say that I was wrong Oh, I know I'm probably much too late To try and apologize for my mistakes But I just want you to know I hope he buys you flowers, I hope he holds your hand Give you all his hours when he has the chance Take you to every party cause I remember how much you loved to dance Do all the things I should have done when I was your man!

Incredible, Baby irrational I never knew it was so sad, just so sad I'm so sorry. Even now I just cannot feel you fall  I don’t even know now. I'm sure you'll wait for me Even now I just cannot deny. I just hold on so tight Until you and I never could breathe  Oh, Wonderful. Incredible, Baby irrational I never knew it was obsessional And I never knew it was with you until you tell me to Baby if it's just, Wonderful. Incredible, Baby irrational I never knew it was so sad, just so sad I'm so sorry. Even now I just cannot feel you feel me  监制 : 舒文@Zoo Music	0
Wonderwall	Today is gonna be the day that  That they're gonna throw it back to you By now you shoulda somehow realized what you gotta do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead us there are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you But I don't know how Because maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you By now you shoulda somehow realized what you're not to do I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now And all the roads that lead you there were winding And all the lights that light the way are blinding There are many things that I would like to say to you But I don't know how I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me And after all You're my wonderwall I said maybe You're gonna be the one that saves me You're gonna be the one that saves me	0
Wrong (feat. Emilia Ali)	Ride Body on mine Gripping your waist as I was On the back of your bike Whipping round the corner Holding onto you, You never let me fall  Like that time You drove through the night When the distance killed me Looked me dead in the eyes Told me not to worry Holding onto you, I thought we had it all  But I was wrong I see it in your face from a mile away Feel it in my veins when you say her name My picture on your wall flipped the other way But still I stay  I know it's wrong I'm just a shadow in your sheets I don't belong Cause you're lying through your teeth, you got me Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, screaming out your name, Cause I like the pain I know it's wrong But it still feels right to me  Called An hour ago Left a message at the tone You should been home I bet you're probably not alone You really thought I didnt know? Cause you still hold My body so close Making promises you know You've already broke You say you'll love me and we'll stay Together til we're grey and old But your hearts so cold I see it in your face from a mile away, Feel it in my veins when you say her name, My picture on your wall flipped the other way But still I stay  I know it's wrong I'm just a shadow in your sheets I don't belong Cause you're lying through your teeth, You got me Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, Screaming out your name Cause I like the pain I know it's wrong But it still feels right to me  Shackled in your chains, losing at your game, screaming out your name Shackled in your chains, screaming out your name But it still feels right to me~	0
Wuthering heights (New Vocal)	Out on the wiley, windy moors We'd roll and fall in green. You had a temper like my jealousy: Too hot, too greedy. How could you leave me, When I needed to possess you?

[00:58.94 [01:02.46 [01:06.64 Ooh, it gets dark! It gets lonely, On the other side from you. I pine a lot. I find a lot Falls through without you. I'ming back, love. Cruel Heathcliff, my one dream, My only master. Too long I roam in the night. I'ming back to his side, to put it right. I'ming home to wuthering, wuthering, Wuthering Heights, I'vee home now cold! [02:22.02 [02:25.19 You know it's me--Cathy! I'vee home. I'm so cold!	0

Yesterday Once More	When I was young I'd listen to the radio Waiting for my favorite songs When they played I'd sing along, It made me smile. Those were such happy times and not so long ago how I wondered where they'd gone. But they're back again just like a long lost friend all the songs I love so well. Every shalalala every wo'wo Still shines. Every shing-a-ling-a-ling That they're starting to sing So fine When they get to the part Where he's breaking her heart It can really make me cry Just like before. It's yesterday once more. (shoobie do lang lang) Looking back on how it was in years gone by And the good times that I had Makes today seem rather sad, So much has changed. It was songs of love that I would sing to them and I'd memorize each word. Those old melodies still sound so good to me As they melt the years away Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines Every shing-a-ling-a-ling That they're starting to sing So fine All my best memories come back clearly to me Some can even make me cry Just like before. It's yesterday once more. (shoobie do lang lang) Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines. Every shing-a-ling-a-ling That they're starting to sing So fine Every shalalala every wo'wo still shines.	0

You Are Not Alone	Another day has gone I'm still all alone How could this be You're not here with me You never said goodbye Someone tell me why Did you have to go And leave my world so cold Everyday I sit and ask myself How did love slip away Something whispers in my ear and says That you are not alone I am here with you Though you're far away I am here to stay But You are not alone I am here with you Though we're far apart You're always in my heart You are not alone All alone Why, oh Just the other night I thought I heard you cry Asking me to come And hold you in my arms I can hear your prayers Your burdens I will bear But first I need your hand Then forever can begin Everyday I sit and ask myself How did love slip away Then something whispers in my ear and says That you are not alone For I am here with you Though you're far away I am here to stay For you are not alone I am here with you Though we're far apart You're always in my heart And you are not alone Oh... Whisper three words and I'll come runnin' Fly...
