1-800-273-8255	I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine Who can relate? I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine I don't wanna be alive I don't wanna be alive I just wanna die today I just wanna die I don't wanna be alive I don't wanna be alive I just wanna die And let me tell you why All this other **** I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it I've been praying for somebody To save me, no one's heroic And my life don't even matter I know it I know it I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it I never had a place to call my own I never had a home Ain't nobody callin' my phone Where you been? Where you at What's on your mind? They say every life precious But nobody care about mine I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine Who can relate? I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine I want you to be alive I want you to be alive You don't gotta die today You don't gotta die I want you to be alive I want you to be alive You don't gotta die Now let me tell you why It's the very first breath When your head's been drownin' under water And it's the light that's in the air When you're there chest-to-chest with a lover It's holding on though the roads long Seeing light in the dark, yeah, these things And when you stare at your reflection Finding hope in who it is I know that you'll thank God you did I know where you been Where you are, where you goin' I know you're the reason I believe in life What's the day without a little night? I'm just tryna shed a little light It can be hard It can be so hard But you gotta live right now You got everything to give right now I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine Who can relate? I've been on the low I been taking my time I feel like I'm out of my mind It feel like my life ain't mine I finally wanna be alive I finally wanna be alive I don't wanna die today I don't wanna die I finally wanna be alive I finally wanna be alive I don't wanna die I don't wanna die(I don't wanna die) I just wanna leave I just wanna leave Pain don't hurt the same, I know The lane I travel feels alone But I'm moving 'til my legs give out And I see my tears melt in the snow But I don't wanna cry I don't wanna cry anymore I wanna feel alive I don't even wanna die anymore Oh I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't even wanna die anymore	1

18	I got a heart and I got a soul Believe me, I use them both We made a star, being the false one I know Baby, I don't want to feel alone So kiss me where I lay down My hands, pressed through your cheeks A long way from the playground I have loved you since we were 18 Long before we both thought the same thing To be loved, and to be in love All I can do to say that These arms we made for holding you I want a love like you made me feel When we were 18 We took a chance God knows I tried Yet all along I knew we'd be fine. So pour me a drink oh love Let's split the night wide open And we'll see everything we can Living love is in slow motion, motion, motion So kiss me where I lay down My hands, pressed through your cheeks A long way from the playground I have loved you since we were 18 Long before we both thought the same thing To be loved, and to be in love All I can do to say that These arms are made for holding you I want a love like you made me feel When we were 18 When we were 18, oh oh When we were 18 So kiss me where I lay down My hands, pressed through your cheeks A long way from the playground I have loved you since we were 18 Long before we both thought the same thing To be loved, and to be in love All I can do to say that These arms we made for holding you I want a love like you made me feel When we were 18 I want a love like you made me feel When we were 18 I want a love like you made me feel When we were 18	1

All Through the Night	All through the night, I'll be awake and I'll be with you. All through the night, this precious time, when time is new. All, all through the night today, knowing that we feel the same, without saying, the same without saying We have no past we won't reach back, Keep with me forward all through the night and once we start a meter clicks, and it goes running all through the night. Until it ends, there is no end. All through the night a stray cat is crying, stray cat sings back. All through the night, they have forgotten what by they do lack. Under those white street lamps, there is a little chance they may see you, a chance they may see you. We have no past, we won't reach back Keep with me forward all through the night, And once we start, the meter clicks, it goes running all through the night. Until it ends there is no end, keep with me forward all through the night and once we start, the meter clicks, and goes running all through the night. Until it ends, there is no end, keep with me forward all through the night. Keep with me all through the night.	1

Anchor	Took the breath from my open mouth, Never known how it broke me down, I went in circles somewhere else Shook the best when you love was home, Storing up on your summer glow, you went in search of someone else And I hear your ship is comin’ in Your tears a sea for me to swim And I hear a storm is comin’ in My dear is it all we’ve ever been? Caught the air in your woven mouth, Leave it all I’ll be heaving how you went In search of someone else Taught the hand that taut the bride, Both our eyes lock to the tide We went in circles somewhere else And I hear your ship is comin’ in Your tears a sea for me to swim And I hear a storm is comin’ in My dear is it all we’ve ever been? Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. oh oh 	1

You know I know them too well I've written it on myself if you can't tell With a melody that climbs And then falls, then falls, then falls Without you without you  How my days, they spin me round And how today, it sets me down And how my days, they spin me around And how today, it sets me down Alongside you, alongside you, alongside you... 	1
Angel	Spend all your time waiting for that second chance For a break that would make it okay There's always some reason to feel not good enough And it's hard at the end of the day I need some distraction oh beautiful release Memory seeps from my veins Let me be empty and weightless and maybe I'll find some peace tonight In the arms of an angel Fly away from here From this dark cold hotel room And the endlessness that you fear You are pulled from the wreckage Of your silent reverie You're in the arms of the angel May you find some comfort here So tired of the straight line And everywhere you turn There's vultures and thieves at your back And the storm keeps on twisting You keep on building the lie That you make up for all that you lack It don't make no difference Escaping one last time It's easier to believe in this sweet madness oh This glorious sadness that brings me to my knees In the arms of an angel Fly away from here From this dark cold hotel room And the endlessness that you fear You are pulled from the wreckage Of your silent reverie You're in the arms of the angel May you find some comfort here You're in the arms of the angel May you find some comfort here	1

Away (电影《踏血寻梅》片尾曲）	Running away before the sky turns too dark Running away when you don't see Running away before the wind got too cold Running away and just don't say You didn't try to show that you care You watched me falling like shooting stars Even I'm only dust in your sky And you don't even want to see  Flowing away like flower you send to me Flowing away at summer's end Flowing away like fires burned down  in the light Just like all of my love for you when you look at me I know I see light But you turned back and just let me cry Maybe it's just too brave to say loud And you don't even care if I stay And you don't even care if I stay And you don't even care if I stay	1

Can't Complain	Lookin' at the cop in the rear view mirror, probably shoulda' stopped but the crosswalk was clear I'll just imagine it's a ticket to a Broadway show. Lookin' at the clouds and they seem kinda funny, probably gonna rain but my outlook is sunny, I'll just imagine that I'm layin' out in Mexico. 'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain, and I know that things won't always go my way and I know life is gonna suck some days. But I can't complain, I can't complain Every day's too short to let it go to waste. And I can't complain, I can't complain. You gotta treat every day like a holiday. And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble, and I know the cookie's gonna crumble, and I know life is gonna suck some days, but I can't complain. Waitin' on a never ending train at the crossing, payin' it no mind 'cause you just keep on talkin', We'll just imagine it's the good old days and take it slow. Spending Christmas eve on the floor at the airport, dying to get back to the people that I care for, smile and just dream about my puppy in my bed back home. 'Cause I know that pleasures gotta come with pain, and I know that things won't always go my way and I know life is gonna suck some days. But I can't complain, I can't complain Every day's too short to let it go to waste. And I can't complain, I can't complain. You gotta treat every day like a holiday. And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble, and I know the cookie's gonna crumble, and I know life is gonna suck some days, If you can't say nothin' good don't say nothin' If you stop to think you could come up with somethin' That makes you feel so good when time's are rough it's okay. I can't complain (Oh oh oh oh oh x2) Don't let it go to waste... Now I can't complain (I can't complain) I can't complain (I can't complain) Every day's too short to let it go to waste. Now I can't complain (I can't complain) I can't complain (I can't complain) You gotta treat every day like a holiday. And I'm tellin' you that I know some days I'm gonna stumble, and I know the cookie's gonna crumble, and I know life is gonna suck some days, but I can't complain.	1
Can't Hold Us	Return of the Mack, get up! What it is, what it does, what it is, what it isn’t. Looking for a better way to get up out of bed Instead of getting on the Internet and checking a new hit me Get up! Thrift shop pimp strut walking, little bit of humble, little bit of cautious Somewhere between like rocky and Cosby sweater gang nope nope y’all can’t copy Yup. Bad, moon walking, this here, is our party, my posse's been on Broadway, And we did it, our way. Grown music, I shed my skin and put my bones into everything I record to it And yet I’m on. Let that stage light go and shine on down, got that Bob Barker suit game and plinko in my style. Money, stay on my craft and stick around for those pounds, But I do that to pass the torch and put on for my town Trust me. On my I-N-D-E-P-E-N-D-E-N-T **** hustler, Chasing dreams since I was 14 with the four track bussing halfway cross that city with the backpack, fat cat, crushing Labels out here, Now they can’t tell me nothing We give that to the people, Spread it across the country Labels out here, Now they can’t tell me nothing We give it to the people, Spread it across the country Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us Like the ceiling can’t hold us Can we go back？This is the moment Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us Like the ceiling can’t hold us Now, can I kick it? Thank you. Yeah I'm so damn grateful. I grew up, really wanted gold fronts But that’s what you get when Wu tang raised you Y’all can’t stop me, go hard like I got an 808 in my heart beat And I’m eating at the beat like you gave a little speed to a great white shark on shark week Raw. Tell me go up. Gone! Deuces goodbye. I got a world to see, and my girl she wanna see Rome, Caesar make you a believer. Now I never ever did it for a throne. That validation comes from giving it back to the people. Now sing a song and it goes like Raise those hands, this is our party We came here to live life like nobody was watching I got my city right behind me If I fall, they got me. Learn from that failure gain humility and then we keep marching ourselves Can we go back?This is the moment Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us Like the ceiling can’t hold us Can we go back?This is the moment Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us Like the ceiling can’t hold us I saw we put our hands up I saw we put our hands up Na na na na na na na na And all my people say Na na na na na na na na Ma-ckle-more And all my people say Na na na na na na na na Ma-ckle-more And all my people say Na na na na na na na na Ma-ckle-more Can we go back? This is the moment Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us Like the ceiling can’t hold us Can we go back?This is the moment Tonight is the night, we’ll fight till it’s over So we put our hands up like the ceiling can’t hold us Like the ceiling can’t hold us.	1

Carry You	Torn down, full of aching  Somehow our youth would take the blame  Worn out, the way we let it stay  Taught how to celebrate it  All out, I'd replicate your pain  Climb down, if only for a taste  Hollowed,but hesitated  Shallow, but full in all your veins  Shadowed by every other weight  Hollow, a doubt can make it  Borrowed a love that never came  Followed, in every other shade  Let it lead your love away I never strayed  Let it bury you away and all your regret and all your pain  I will carry you away  Let it lead your love away I never strayed  Let it bury you away  Fade me away I won't ever be the same  Oh, Fade me away I won't ever be the same  Oh, Fade me away I won't ever be the same 	1

Christmas Lights	Christmas night, another fight Tears we cried, a flood Got all kinds of poison in Of poison in my blood I took my feet to Oxford street Trying to right a wrong Just walk away, those windows say But I can't believe she's gone When you're still waiting for the snow to fall Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all  Up above candles on air flicker Oh they flicker and they float But I'm up here holding on to all those chandeliers of hope Like some drunken Elvis singing I go singing out of tune Singing how I always loved you darling And I always will But when you're still waiting for the snow to fall Doesn't really feel like Christmas at all Still waiting for the snow to fall It doesn't really feel like Christmas at all Those Christmas Lights Light up the street Down where the sea and city meet May all your troubles soon be gone Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on Those Christmas Lights Light up the street Maybe they'll bring her back to me Then all my troubles will be gone Ohh Christmas Lights keep shining on Oh Ohh Christmas Lights Light up the streets Light up the fireworks in me May all your troubles soon be gone Those Christmas Lights keep shining on	1
Christmas Tree Farm	My winter nights are taken up by static Stress and holiday shopping traffic But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else Just like magic  In my heart is a Christmas tree farm Where the people would come To dance under sparkling lights Bundled up in their mittens and coats And the cider would flow And I just wanna be there tonight Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everything is icy and blue And you would be there, too Under the mistletoe Watching the fire glow And telling me, I love you Just being in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true  In my heart is a Christmas tree farm There's a light in the barn We'd run inside out from the cold In the town kids are dreaming of sleighs And they're warm and they're safe They wake to see a blanket of snow Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon Mistakes are forgiven And everything is icy and blue And you would be there, too Under the mistletoe Watching the fire glow And telling me, I love you Just being in your arms Takes me back to that little farm Where every wish comes true Oh baby, yeah And when I'm feeling alone You remind me of home Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas And when the world isn't fair I pretend that we're there Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you) Under the mistletoe (To you) Watching the fire glow And telling me, I love you Oh, oh, oh Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling) Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas I love you Oh, oh, oh Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know) Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas May your every wish come true  I love you	1

Circles	 I know I don't have my shit together  When you feel good I’m under the weather  And I feel like all my friends know who they are  But I'm still lost staring at the stars  And I know that you know that you're on my mind  And I know I’m a mess but it feels so right cause  I don't want no, no, nobody  But your hands all on my body  Do you feel that way too, too  I don't know where I'm going  Running off of emotions  Tryna hide away from facing my own head  I'm jumping these hurdles and I'm  Running in circles, but if i'm running in circles  Then I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  The days go slow waiting for the weekend  Not feeling social I'm not sure what I’m needing  And I feel like all my friends know what they want  But I still see you even when it’s dark  And I know that you know that you're on my mind  And I know I’m a mess but it feels so right cause  I don't want no, no, nobody  But your hands all on my body  Do you feel that way too, too  I don't know where I'm going  Running off of emotions  Tryna hide away from facing my own head  I’m jumping these hurdles and I'm  Running in circles, but if I'm running in circles  Then I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you  I hope I end up with you	1
Citizen of Glass	Rend a black drop from my heart With the weight of days The end of time has just begun I hear it call your name And no straining of the string Can reverse what will begin Some let go and some hold on There is no mistake If I could wash all ill away Tell me would you stay?

City of Stars	City of stars Are you shining just for me? City of stars There's so much that I can't see Who knows? I felt it from the first embrace I shared with you That now our dreams They've finally come true  City of stars Just one thing everybody wants There in the bars And through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants It's love Yes, all we're looking for is love from someone else A rush A glance A touch A dance To look in somebody's eyes To light up the skies To open the world and send them reeling A voice that says, I'll be here And you'll be alright I don't care if I know Just where I will go 'Cause all that I need's this crazy feeling A rat-tat-tat on my heart… Think I want it to stay  City of stars Are you shining just for me? City of stars You never shined so brightly	1
Clear (Shawn Wasabi Remix)	Words fall out of my mouth They drift to the ground and they don't make a sound I'll try to assemble them back to the place in my head But I fear that I lack The proper speak that I need To narrate the scene, to tell you these things The proper place for my thoughts I know that I'm not and you know that I'm not  So clear and transparent Well I'll try but I can't promise it So dark but delicate Well I'm rough around the edges and You can try to smooth me down But I’m not, no, I’m not And you can try to smooth me down But I’m not ready to forget You can try to smooth me down But I’m not, no, I’m not And you can try to smooth me down But I’m not ready to forget You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down But I’m not ready to forget You can try to smooth me down  Take back all that I've said I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again It’s not like me to pretend But the best part of me is the worst I can give But you make me so terrified I tried to reply but I’m shaking inside You gave me a tongue just to tie I’ll swallow my pride if you swear not to lie  Hard to read and hard to speak to But don’t take my word Cause I’m honestly so bored of being Misunderstood, I’m not So clear and transparent Well I'll try but I can't promise it So dark but delicate Well I'm rough around the edges and You can try to smooth me down But I’m not, no, I’m not And you can try to smooth me down But I’m not ready to forget You can try to smooth me down But I’m not, no, I’m not And you can try to smooth me down But I’m not ready to forget You can try to smooth me down But I’m not, no, I’m not And you can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down You can try to smooth me down	1
Close (Brooks Remix)	Rising with each beat That the music is bringing We're all flames in the fire That keeps burning  We're inviting the night in  Welcome oh my heart's so full I'm devoting myself to the night There's no motive  We're just listening we're existing  We stay where the music plays Where the lights drop low and the people's swayin'  Rising with each beat That the music is bringing We're all flames in the fire That keeps burning  We're inviting the night in  Welcome oh my hearts so full I'm devoting myself to the night There's no motive  We're just listening we're existing  We stay where the music plays Where the lights drop low and the people's swayin'	1

Closer (ARMNHMR Remix)	Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you I drink too much and that's an issue but I’m OK Hey, you tell your friends it was nice to meet them But I hope I never see them again I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car And four years, no calls Now you're looking pretty in a hotel bar And I can't stop No, I can’t stop So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover That I know you can't afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder We ain't ever getting older... You look as good as the day I met you I forget just why I left you, I was insane Stay and play that Blink-182 song That we beat to death in Tucson, OK I know it breaks your heart Moved to the city in a broke down car and Four years, no call Now I'm looking pretty in a hotel bar And I can't stop No, I can't stop So baby pull me closer in the backseat of your Rover That I know you can’t afford Bite that tattoo on your shoulder Pull the sheets right off the corner Of the mattress that you stole From your roommate back in Boulder We ain’t ever getting older...

I can’t say ‘I love you’ through a million walls So tell me when will you be closer to me?  Closer to me  Do you miss me like I miss you  Or see my face in everything you do? I dream about you in the light of day  I’m not okay and Days go by Are we getting closer to a better life? I can’t say ‘I love you’ through a million walls So tell me when will you be closer to me?  All I know is that I want you here And when you’re gone I disappear All I know is every time you leave You take the biggest part of me with you  Days go by Are we getting closer to a better life? I can’t say ‘I love you’ through a million walls So tell me when will you be closer  Days go by Are we getting closer to a better life?

Clouds	"Time tried to stop one Cold cold night in June Somehow I knew you Kept on dancing through And you jumped on a flight in the Darkest of blues, took a trip to paradise Through the stars and back over the moon Oh, tell me it's true, oh Please just tell me you're alright Are you way up in the sky Laughing, smiling, looking down Saying ""one day we'll meet in the clouds"" Up in the clouds No one I knew stood Half as bright as you But now you shine on The perfect avenue And the light that you left it helps me to see A way through all the bitterness A way to who I really want to be Oh, light up the streets, oh Please just tell me you're alright Are you way up in the sky Laughing, smiling, looking down Saying ""one day we'll meet in the clouds"" Up in the clouds Up in the clouds Some nights I still hear your whispers And your memories they hang like a picture Oh, you'll always be just like a sister Some nights I still see your smile Your number I wish I could dial Oh, but I can't wait to talk for a while, oh Please just tell me you're alright Are you way up in the sky Laughing, smiling, looking down I know one day we'll meet in the clouds Up in the clouds"	1

Cold Night	while the sunlight freezes up i think of you again and the snow is lying cold looks like the blanket on this town and it drips down from the roof tops while i hear the winter whisper that everything is naked and stark underneath you coming to my mind like so many times before seems like it's been forever since i couldn't let you go and all my mistakes dig themselves into my heart again and all your words they come back so much clearer to me now and it's cold , cold night leaves me breathless and in doubt there's a silence and a calm tonight and i wonder if i was right i remember every word that you said but i wonder if i was really the love you drink it all of full and the trees white and drunk and strip down of their clothes and i realize i am not sure what you look like anymore but every cell says i remember you well but it's been so long since i saw you laugh out loud and if i could , i ply our boat, snow it tonight cause something is erupting in the ground underneath and it's cold , cold night leaves me breathless and in doubt there's silence and cold tonight and i wonder if you were right and it's cold , cold night leaves me breathless and in doubt there's silence and cold tonight and i wonder if anyone was right	1
Cold	It’s been lonely, Trying get your attention from a thousand miles away. And you know me, always overthinking the worst possibilities. Yeah, we both know, in between you and me, there’s an ocean. Castaway in a sea and it’s frozen. I’m exposed, can’t you see, all I need is a little warmth. Without your arms around me, Without you on my skin, Without you on my body, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be desperate, or pretend that I’m not torn, But I don’t want to let go of the things that keep me warm. Without you I’m just cold. I built a little boat with a sail From the memories I’ve been collecting. And I’ll hold out for the wind to blow me, Take me home the whole way, in your direction. Yeah, we both know, in between you and me there’s an ocean. And I’m just trying to get a little closer. Pull me in, cause I’m here and all I need is little warmth. Without your arms around me, Without you on my skin, Without you on my body, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be desperate, or pretend that I’m not torn, But I don’t want to let go of the things that keep me warm. Without you I’m just cold. Without you I’m just cold. And I need a little fire and you’re my gasoline. Light me up, I’m burning, with all these things I feel. I’ll always hold this flame for you, But it’s naked on the breeze. So let me in, don’t lock me out don't cast me out to sea. Without your arms around me, Without you on my skin, Without you on my body, I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I don’t mean to be desperate, or pretend that I’m not torn, But I don’t want to let go of the things that keep me warm. Without you I’m just cold. Without you I’m just cold. Without you I’m just cold. Without you I’m just cold.	1

Corazon	"Thinking back to the whacks that we used to take Rolling joints to a point with a roach and shake Sipping on Summer Ale in September sun Jump in the back seat where we had some fun Cruise out on the boat to the house of stilts Kiss me underneath till the passion wilts Never will I find another crazy lady putting up wooden houses in Haiti Closing up your eyes cause you drink too much Open up your thighs cause you like my touch I want to grow old on Brazilian beaches Getting tan in the sand with her two ripe peaches Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Six-packs and a flask from a Scottish lake Been a mess since the best chest game to date Hit the map for a tap and a little loving The bone I wrap for buns in ovens Living by the ocean, going through the motions Drinking with my head in a noose Never known a better potion to let my liver soak in No I bet I'm telling the truth Holding all the good stories Coke and all it's glories Slipped up, Tripped up…. Tooth Bust on the pavement, make another payment, running like Johns Wilks Booth, oof! Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Rolling on through Where do you belong Holding on to you Just carry on Truer words never spoken, ""Quick to be broken"" Change is a notion you should learn like lotion On the hand that you're hoping to Land the next open, girl that you're scoping Pillows you be groping Forever will I be insistent, that distance, is the crux of my existence And whoever would be to wish this away this instant I'd give assistance Never would I need to wish this away like wish lists and family business Clever would I be to diss this and kiss the first fish thats close to British Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon Back and forth through custom lines Searching for my Argentine Now I need another home To rest my complex corazon"	1
Cottage for Sale	Our little dream castle with every dream gone Is lonely and silent, the shades are all drawn And my heart is heavy as I gaze upon A cottage for sale The lawn we were proud of is waving in hay Our beautiful garden has withered away Where you planted roses, the weeds seem to say A cottage for sale From every single window, I see your face But when I reach a window, there's empty space The key's in the mail box the same as before But no one is waiting for me any more The end of the story is told on the door A cottage for sale Well, our key's in the mail box the same as before No one is waiting for me any more The end of the story is told on the door A cottage for sale A cottage for sale	1
Could This Be Love	Woke up this morning, Just sat in my bed, 8 a.m first thing in my head, Is a certain someone, Who's always on my mind, He treats me like a lady in every way, He smiles and warms me through up the day, Should I tell him I love you, Wish I knew what to say! Could this be love that I feel, So strong, so deep and so real, If I lost you would I ever heal, Could this be love that I feel? Could this be love that I feel, So strong, so deep and so real, If I lost you would I ever heal, Could this be love that I feel? The way he looks, So deep in my eyes, Our hearts are so warm, I just wanna cry, Then he's so hardworking, He wants to be someone. Should I tell him that I love you, What if he doesn't say it too, I'm getting so nervous, What should I do Could this be love that I feel, So strong, so deep and so real, If I lost you would I ever heal, Could this be love that I feel? Could this be love that I feel, So strong, so deep and so real, If I lost you would I ever heal, Could this be love that I feel? Will it be my turn, Two hearts beating together as one, No more loneliness, Only love, laughter and fun Could this be love that I feel, So strong, so deep and so real, If I lost you, would I ever heal, Could this be love that I feel? Could this be love that I feel, So strong, so deep and so real, If I lost you would I ever heal, Could this be love that I feel? Could this be love that I feel?...	1

Dead In The Water (Live At RTÉ 2FM Studios, Dublin)	For the shore And the night is slipping through my hands I fall into the sea Like the empire built on the sand I’ve been thinking about the days When we had no money That photograph of you Well it still seems funny Gotta get back to the promised land  So don’t walk away love There’s never enough That could make me crash On the broken glass Let the storm rage I’d die on the waves But I will not rest While love lies dead in the water  Dead in the water… In the water Dead in the water  I’m waiting for the calm As the storm is getting under my skin  I’m trying to fix the hole in my head Where the rain gets in  It’s dripping in my ear And it don’t sound funny I’m gonna take you out When I get some money We’re trying to get it back to the promised land  So don’t walk away love There’s never enough That could make me crash On the broken glass Let the storm rage I’d die on the waves But I will not rest While love lies dead in the water  Dead in the water… In the water Dead in the water  So don’t walk away love There’s never enough That could make me crash On the broken glass Let the storm rage I’d die on the waves But I will not rest While love lies dead in the water There’s never enough That could make me crash On the broken glass Let the storm rage I’d die on the waves But I will not rest While love lies dead in the water  Dead in the water… In the water Dead in the water 	1

End of Me	There's a fire burning inside me cold steel calls out my name Tempted to give in to the rage Torn apart by this affliction locked up inside myself This life is much too young to fade I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside Incomplete but now I see This won't be the end of me The world around me sells an empty promise They build you up just to watch you fall It's time to meet this face to face I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside Incomplete but now I see This won't be the end of me Black and white melt into grey till every truth is stripped away When nothing's wrong nothing's ok Everyone has been betrayed I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside Incomplete but now I see This won't be the end of me I ran away from the pain always breaking down inside Incomplete but now I see This won't be the end of me	1

Eugene	Light struck from the lemon tree  What if I'd never seen hysterical light from Eugene?  Lemon yoghurt, remember I pulled at your shirt I dropped the ashtray on the floor  I just wanted to be near you  Emerald Park, wonders never cease  The man who taught me to swim, he couldn't quite say my first name  Like a Father he led community water on my head And he called me Subaru  And now I want to be near you  Since I was old enough to speak I've said it with alarm  Some part of me was lost in your sleeve Where you hid your cigarettes  No I'll never forget  I just want to be near you  Still I pray to what I cannot see  In the sprinkler I mark the evidence known from the start  From the bed near your death, and all the machines that made a mess Far away the falcon flew  Now I want to be near you  What's left is only bittersweet  For the rest of my life, admitting the best is behind me  Now I'm drunk and afraid, wishing the world would go away What's the point of singing songs  If they'll never even hear you?	1

I’ll keep on searching ‘Til I no longer can  I'm going places That have never been found The streets are crowded But there’s no one around I stumbled softly As I fell to the ground I screamed and shouted But I can’t hear a sound  Are you with me? Is this fiction? I’ve always known you Since the story began  Can you feel me In these moments? I’ll keep on searching ‘Til I no longer can  Cold and hollow All this time Would you follow All the signs? Come tomorrow I’ll be fine I thought I found you But I don’t understand  Are you with me? Is this fiction? I’ve always known you Since the story began Can you feel me In these moments? I’ll keep on searching ‘Til I no longer can 	1

Forgettable	To the kid in the corner Trapped in the shadows of doubt. Passing time till it's over Just hoping one day you'll be found. Tell me who threw your chance away? Did they even know your name? If you live in the echo your heart never beats as loud. you're not invisible. you're not alone you worth more than they know. but you've been running running running. when you should have known. you're not forgettable. forgettable. forgettable. I've seen a feel of rejection inside your eyes whisper of truth, lost in the quiet night. I know it's more than you can bare It may seem like no one cares. when your world is the darkest remember the sun will rise. you're not invisible. you're not alone you worth more than they know. but you've been running running running. but you should have known. you're not forgettable. forgettable. forgettable. you're not forgettable you're not replaceable. but you're perfectly you you're not invisible you're not erasable, No. you're not alone you worth more than they know. but you've been running running running. but you've been running running running. you're not forgettable. forgettable. forgettable. you're not forgettable.	1
Four Lean Hounds	Look at a picture of you on a horse With a bridle your father bought On a trip to Vermont in the fall Autumn is staring you down red and brown By the mane of a dying elm And the look on your face says it all. Four lean hounds in a row Where in the world did you go? Look at a picture of you, lucky lad In a jacket your father had When he fought in the war on TV Summer is wearing you down like a crown(?) Like the wind on a weathervane As you stand in the shade like a tree Four lean hounds in a row Where in the world did you go? Four lean hounds in a row Has anyone seen the king or the queen Did they look anything like you and me? Has anyone seen my king or my queen Did they look anything like you and me? Look at a picture of you in a crowd Where your memories are not allowed Just the weight of the light on the leaves. Four lean hounds in a row Where in the world did you go?

Fu-Gee-La	"  We used to be number 10 Now we're permanent one, In the battle lost my finger, Mic became my arm Pistol nozzle hits your nasal, blood becomes lukewarm  Tell the woman be easy Naah squeeze the Charmin Test Wyclef, see death flesh get scorned.  Beat you so bad make you feel like you ain't wanna be born  And tell your friends stay the hell out of my lawn. Chicken George became Dead George stealin' chickens from my farm.  Damn, Another dead pigeon  If your mafiosos then I'm bringin' on Haitian Sicilians Nobody's shootin', my body's made of hand grenade  Girl bled to death while she was tongue-kissing a razor blade.  That sounds sick maybe one eday I'll write a horror Blackula comes to the ghetto, jacks an ACURA  Stevie Wonder sees Crack Babies Be-Coming Enemies of their own families.  Armageddon come you know we soon done  Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump  A boy on the side of Babylon, trying to front like he's down with  Mount Zion. Oooh La La La, It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang  Oooh La La La, It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring  Oooh La La La La La La Lalala La Laaah,  Sweeeeet Thing  Yeah in saloons we drink Boone's and battle goons till high noon,  Bust rap toons on flat spoons, take no shorts like poon poon's.  See hoochies pop coochies, for Gucci's and Lucci Find me in my Mitsubishi, eatin' sushi, bumpin' Fugees.  Hey Hey Hey Try to take the crew and we don't play play Say say say Like Paul McCartney, not hardly, ODD-ly enough I can see right through your bluff ****** huff and they puff but they can't handle us, WE BUST  Cause we fortified, I could never hide, seen ""Cooley High"",  Cried when Cochise died. I'm twisted, black-listed by some other negroes, Don't remove my Polos on the first episode.  Ha Ha Ha Ha, You shouldn't diss refugees, and Ha Ha Ha Ha, You whole sound set's bootie , and  Ha Ha Ha Ha, You have to respect JERSEY, cause I'm superfly when  I'm super-high on the Fu-Gee-La.  Oooh La La La, It's the way that we rock when we're doing our thang Oooh La La La,  It's the natural LA that the Refugees Bring  Oooh La La La La La La Lalala La Laaah,  Sweeeeet Thing  I sit 90 degrees underneath palm trees,  Smokin' beadies as I burn my calories, Brooklyn roof tops become Brooklyn tee-pees,  Who that be, enemies, wanna see the death of me.  From Hawaii to Hawthorne, I run marathons, like  Buju Banton, I'm a true champion, like,  Farakkhan reads his Daily Qu'ran it's a phenomenon,  lyrics fast like Ramadan. What's goin' on Armageddon come you know we soon done Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump  A boy on the side of Babylon, trying to front like he's down with  Mount Zion. What's goin' on Armageddon come you know we soon done  Gun by my side just in case I gotta rump A boy on the side of Babylon, trying to front like he's down with  Mount Zion.

Fuerteventura	You're always such a fool And in your eyes so blue I see the life I never had before Do you remember when We used to live things separate We hadn't met or thought That could be possible I'm glad you had your life So good to listen to your past All of those things brought you With me and now we're two You're always such a fool And in your eyes so blue I see the life I never had before You always talk so smooth And in your voice, so true I hear the dream I never had before But if I try to think Of something better than this Heaven comes down And reminds the luck we live You're always such a fool And in your eyes so blue I see the life I never had before You always talk so smooth And in your voice, so true I hear the dream I never had before	1

Goodnight	Sometimes I almost forget these weary bones. Watching children play in the park Under these old familiar trees. They help me feel the glow of my youth. So many years have fallen between that boy And this ghost I am to you. It's a bittersweet closing of the blinds, Where the sunlight cast upon the world dims on the inside. And all the pieces that once made up who you are Fade with the darkness of each love who dies before. Look at me. I'm a lifetime of memories. Looking back so far, so longingly At you my darling. You're so beautiful in this photograph. In every moment we ever saved. And you were beautiful when you said goodbye three years ago today. When you're young, you never believe the story ends. That you'll one day out-live your fairytales And lay to rest your dearest friends. Tomorrow was my crutch and it collapsed under the weight Of all the things I never said before it was too late. Summer is over and now I feel it in my bones. Alone in the dark. Alone in the cold. The sunlight is a candle Dieing down in the quiet sky. Goodnight dear world. Goodnight old trees. Goodnight, and goodbye.	1

Grace	"My heart is so proud. My mind is so unfocused. I see the things You do through me As great things I have done And now You gently break me, Then lovingly You take me And hold me as my Father and mold me as my Maker. I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you. And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace  At times I may grow weak and feel a bit discouraged, Knowing that someone, somewhere Could do a better job. For who am I to serve You? I know I don't deserve You. And that's the part that burns in my heart And keeps me hanging on I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace you are so Patient with me, Lord.  As I work with You, I'm learning what Your grace really means. The price that I could never pay was paid at Calvary. So, instead of trying to repay You, I'm learning to simply obey You By giving up my life to You For all that You've given to me I ask You: ""How many times will You pick me up, When I keep on letting You down? And each time I will fall short of Your glory, How far will forgiveness abound?"" And You answer: ""My child, I love you. And as long as you're seeking My face, You'll walk in the power of My daily sufficient grace."""	1

How Far I'll Go	I've been staring at the edge of the water 'Long as I can remember, never really knowing why I wish I could be the perfect daughter But I come back to the water, no matter how hard I try Every turn I take, every trail I track Every path I make, every road leads back To the place I know, where I can not go, where I long to be  See the line where the sky meets the sea? It calls me And no one knows, how far it goes If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me One day I'll know, if I go there's just no telling how far I'll go  Go-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh  I know everybody on this island, seems so happy on this island Everything is by design I know everybody on this island has a role on this island So maybe I can roll with mine I can lead with pride, I can make us strong I'll be satisfied if I play along But the voice inside sings a different song What is wrong with me?  See the light as it shines on the sea?

In The End	(It starts with one) One thing I don't know why It doesn't even matter How hard you try Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know Time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by As the pendulum swings Watch it count down To the end of the day The clock ticks life away It's so unreal Didn't look out below Watch the time go Right out the window Trying to hold on, But didn't even know Wasted it all just To watch you go I kept everything inside and Even though I tried, It all fell apart What it meant to me will Eventually be a Memory of a time when I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter One thing, I don't know why It doesn’t even matter How hard you try, Keep that in mind I designed this rhyme, To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way You were mocking me Acting like I was Part of your property Remembering all the Times you fought with me I'm surprised it got so (far) Things aren't the way They were before You wouldn't even Recognise me anymore Not that you Knew me back then But it all comes Back to me (in the end) You kept everything inside And even though I tried, It all fell apart What it meant to me will Eventually be a Memory of a time when I I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I've put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There's only one thing you should know I tried so hard And got so far But in the endIt doesn't even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn't even matter	1

Who's gonna rock you When the sun won't let you sleep? Who's waking up to drive you home When you're drunk and all alone? Who's gonna walk you Through the dark side of the morning?

Jesus Christ	Jesus Christ, that's a pretty face The kind you'd find on someone that could save If they don't put me away Well, it'll be a miracle  Do you believe you're missing out? That everything good is happening somewhere else With nobody in your bed The night is hard to get through  And I will die all alone And when I arrive I won't know anyone  Jesus Christ, I'm alone again So what did you do those three days you were dead? Because this problem is gonna last More than the weekend  Jesus Christ, I'm not scared to die But I'm a little bit scared of what comes after Do I get the gold chariot? Do I float through the ceiling?  Or do I divide and fall apart Cause my bright is too slight to hold back all my dark This ship went down in sight of land And at the gates does Thomas ask to see my hands?  I know you're coming in the night like a thief But I've had some time alone, to hone my lying technique I know you think that I'm someone you can trust But I'm scared I'll get scared and I swear I'll try to nail you back up So do you think that we could work out a sign So I'll know it's you and that it's over so I won't even try I know you're coming for the people like me But we all got wood and nails And we turn out hate in factories We all got wood and nails And we turn out hate in factories We all got wood and nails And we sleep inside of this machine 	1

Jocelin	So you crossed the line, how’d u get that far？ Thought u give it a try . tell me was it worth at all of the rouse u had beneath it all？ So u have ur arms wrapped around ur eyes， Shall I try to pretend like it’s so fine，and I haven’t been losing sleep at all？ And did u think of me before u fell so farbelow the line that u drew up for yourself? As i look at you now , i feel like walking away from all of the pain you throw on my way . And everybody watching saw me fall . so, out of love with you just now. so u flushed a smile, how’s that working now？ U controlled everything and everyone around. Was it worth all the things u lost? U know， it’s too cold inside to stay with u here, when all u do is try to stop me from fear. u’re like u’re not even here! as i look at u now i feel like walking away from all of the pain you throw on my way . and everybody watching saw me fall . so, out of love with u. I wish I never met u right now This is so unlike u right now U ‘re someone else U are u oooohhh And as i look at you now , i feel like walking away from all of the pain you throw on my way . and everybody watching saw me fall . so, out of love with u just now.

Love Story (Taylor’s Version)	"We were both young when I first saw you. I close my eyes and the flashback starts: I'm standing there On a balcony in summer air.  See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns, See you make your way through the crowd, And say, ""Hello."" Little did I know...  That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet."" And I was crying on the staircase Begging you, ""Please don't go."" And I said,  ""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run. You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story. baby, just say 'Yes'.""  So, I sneak out to the garden to see you. We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew. So, close your eyes, Escape this town for a little while. Oh, oh.  'Cause you were Romeo. I was a scarlet letter. And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet."" But you were everything to me. I was begging you, ""Please don't go!"" And I said,  ""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone. I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess. It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'.""  Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel This love is difficult but it's real. Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess. It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'.""  Oh, oh, oh.  I got tired of waiting, Wondering if you were ever coming around. My faith in you was fading, When I met you on the outskirts of town. And I said,  ""Romeo, save me. I've been feeling so alone. I keep waiting for you, but you never come. Is this in my head? I don't know what to think."" He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said,  ""Marry me, Juliet. You'll never have to be alone I love you, and that's all I really know. I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress. It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'.""  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  'Cause we were both young when I first saw you."	1

Love the Way You Lie (Clean)	"Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is [Eminem I can only tell you what it feels like And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight High off of love, drunk from my hate, It's like I'm huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She ******* hates me and I love it. Wait! Where you going? ""I'm leaving you"" No you ain't. Come back we're running right back. Here we go again It's so insane cause when it's going good, it's going great I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed I snapped Who's that dude? I don't even know his name I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again I guess I don't know my own strength Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Eminem You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe When you're with 'em You meet and neither one of you even knows what hit 'em Got that warm fuzzy feeling Yeah, them those chills you used to get 'em Now you're getting ******* sick of looking at 'em You swore you'd never hit 'em; never do nothing to hurt 'em Now you're in each other's face spewing venom in your words when you spit them You push pull each other's hair, scratch claw hit 'em Throw 'em down pin 'em So lost in the moments when you're in them It's the rage that took over it controls you both So they say you're best to go your separate ways Guess if they don't know you 'cause today that was yesterday Yesterday is over, it's a different day Sound like broken records playing over but you promised her Next time you show restraint You don't get another chance Life is no Nintendo game But you lied again Now you get to watch her leave out the window I guess that's why they call it window pane Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie [Eminem Now I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean And we fall back into the same patterns, same routine But your temper's just as bad as mine is You're the same as me But when it comes to love you're just as blinded Baby, please come back It wasn't you, baby it was me Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano All I know is I love you too much to walk away though Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk I told you this is my fault Look me in the eyeball Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall Next time. There won't be no next time I apologize even though I know its lies I'm tired of the games I just want her back I know I'm a liar If she ever tries to ******* leave again Im'a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire Just gonna stand there and watch me burn I'm just gonna But that's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's alright because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie I love the way you lie"	1

Mine (Illenium Remix)	When it went down It was so hard to breathe I gave up everything In the slow fall down to the floor Life was escaping me I couldn’t find myself Till it was all lost Not anymore I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris Till it’s time I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually I know it’s mine I found gold in the wreckage Put it on a necklace Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine I wear it like a message So I don’t forget it Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine I know that it's mine I know that it's mine I know that it's mine I know that it's mine I know that it's mine I know that it's mine I know that it's mine Facing the change But it’s still tough to see At first I fought it all I was so mean I’m still unsure How it’s supposed to be But digging everyday now by the skin of my teeth Until I learn I’m holding on to all the pieces of my heart’s debris Till it’s time I’ll… I’ll pull it together and fix myself eventually I know it’s mine I found gold in the wreckage Put it on a necklace Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine I wear it like a message So I don’t forget it Keepin’ it cause I-I-I, I know that it’s mine I know that it’s mine I know that it’s mine I know that it’s mine I know that it’s mine	1
Miracle	It's not just a phase Now let me explain I'm working through some **** Sometimes I'm medicated It's hard to relay The thoughts in my brain I'm working for a life that's not domesticated  It never goes the way that you planned Success is a door that always slams I'm trying to break it I'm trying to break it Searching for words, and praying for signs I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme Don't know how to say it Don't know how to say it  That I'm losing my mind Trying to find the perfect line I think I'm running out of time I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle Yeah I'm losing my mind Counting seconds passing by And I don't know when I'll be fine I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle A miracle  It's not just a show I need you to know I'm trying to keep it real, sometimes it's complicated This battle for gold is killing my soul It's hard to be yourself when all you feel is jaded  It never goes the way that you planned Success is a door that always slams I'm trying to break it I'm trying to break it Searching for words, and praying for signs I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme Don't know how to say it Don't know how to say it  That I'm losing my mind Trying to find the perfect line I think I'm running out of time I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle Yeah I'm losing my mind Counting seconds passing by And I don't know when I'll be fine I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle A miracle  I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle It never goes the way that you planned Success is a door that always slams I'm trying to break it I'm trying to break it Searching for words, and praying for signs I struggle to find the rhythm and rhyme Don't know how to say it Don't know how to say I'm minutes away from going insane  Cause I'm losing my mind Trying to find the perfect line I think I'm running out of time I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle Yeah I'm losing my mind Counting seconds passing by And I don't know when I'll be fine I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle A miracle  I need a miracle I need a mira-miracle, a mira-miracle A miracle	1

Not Another Song About Love	Let it out, been building up you better let it out Say everything you've been meaning now, I want it to burn. When you tell me I'm such a wreck, it isn't easy cleaning up your mess. It's like I've got a rope around my neck, she says it won't hurt.  But everything you do makes my heart race I can't even think straight, is this just a game to you? Reruns every night, it's always the same fight & I think you should know...  I hate your touch, I hate your mouth, I can't stand every single word that falls out. But you're all that I've been dreaming of, This is not another song about love. I hate your voice, I hate your lips, I hate how bad I wanna steal your kiss. But you're all that I've been dreaming of, This is not another song about love.  Asphyxiated just to say the least, And with your eyes you're suffocating me. Emptied my lungs, it's getting hard to breathe, You couldn't care less.  But everything you do makes my heart race I can't even think straight, is this just a game to you? Reruns every night, it's always the same fight & I think you should know...  I hate your touch, I hate your mouth, I can't stand every single word that falls out. But you're all that I've been dreaming of, This is not another song about love.  I hate your voice, I hate your lips, I hate how bad I wanna steal your kiss. But you're all that I've been dreaming of, This is not another song about love.  The sky fades from blue to gray Her touch is just like an ocean, still I'm drowning How bad I wanna sink & let it take me away. I don't know why I come back I do every time We get close to the end It's the finish line. Sing these words for the girl I've been dreaming of Is this just another song about love?  Let it out, been building up I better let it out... Say everything that I've been meaning now, dreaming bout. I mean it now, I need it now. I need your touch, I have no doubt I want your love until it all runs out. Cause you're all I've been dreaming of, Is this just another song about love? I need your voice, I need your lips I need you bad, I wanna steal your kiss. Cause you're all that I've been dreaming of This is just another song about Another song about love.	1

Ordinary Day	It was an ordinary day I woke up on a wave I filled a sail And made my way to the shore I blew through the center of your town Came upon your house through your window and I came through your screen door I asked you Can you hear me blow? Though you don’t know Where I’m coming from Or where I go? It was an ordinary night I met some fireflies I danced around with them Until about 9 o’clock Heard your footsteps on the road I ran to bring you home And I whispered through the leaves Up and down your block Oh I’m a summer breeze I brush across your cheek I have always been And I will always be You can hear me blow Although you don’t know Where I’m coming from Or where I go It’s me when you catch the fragrance of spring When tall trees sway It’s me in the cold winter sting In the alleyway I am the sigh While all creation groans and waits You can hear me speak If you’re listenin I will always be And I have always been You can hear me blowin Although you don’t know Where I’m coming from Or where I go La la la	1
Our Song	I was riding shot-gun with my hair undone in the front seat of his car He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel The other on my heart I look around turn the radio down He says baby is something wrong I say nothing I was just thinking how we don't have a song And he says Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date man I didn't kiss her and I should have And when I got home before I said amen Asking God if he could play it again I was walking up the front porch steps after everything that day Had gone all wrong and been trampled on And lost and thrown away Got to the hallway well on my way to my lovin' bed I almost didn't notice all the roses And the note that said Our song is the slamming screen door Sneakin' out late tapping on your window When we're on the phone and you talk real slow Cause it's late and your mama don't know Our song is the way you laugh The first date man I didn't kiss her and I should have And when I got home before I said amen Asking God if he could play it again I've heard every album listened to the radio Waited for something to come along That was as good as our song Cause our song is the slamming screen door Sneaking out late tapping on his window When we're on the phone and he talks real slow Cause it's late and his mama don't know Our song is the way he laughs The first date man I didn't kiss him and I should have And when I got home before I said amen Asking God if he could play it again I was riding shot-gun with my hair undone In the front seat of his car I grabbed a pen and an old napkin And I wrote down our song	1

Pedalo	It seems as good a day as anytime To start my trek across the ocean With no funds for ship or sail I'll use my legs and my devotion An aqua bike will be my vessel And high adventure the land I seek So farewell friends who've come to gather Waving hankies tear on cheek It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo My joy was surging spirit soaring The sky was huge the sea was placid But soon my vim was somewhat dimmed By bucketloads of lactic acid And then a ship took me aboard Was full of whiskey and hearty sailors I rested up then pedaled onwards Once I found out they were whalers It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo I saw a mermaid thwarted pirates Wrestled sea squids this and more But as I ponder that horizon I fancy someone moved the shore Oh Hope can come and hope can go But for the most part seems to go But still I huff and still I puff In my yellow pedalo It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo It's a long long way to go on a pedalo a pedalo It's a long long way to go It's a long long way to go It's a long long way to go	1

Pompeii	I was left to my own devices Many days fell away with nothing to show  And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all? And if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like You've been here before? How am I gonna be an optimist about this? How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  We were caught up and lost in all of our vices In your pose as the dust settles around us  And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all? And if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like You've been here before? How am I gonna be an optimist about this? How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  Oh where do we begin? The rubble or our sins? Oh where do we begin? The rubble or our sins?  And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all? And if you close your eyes, Does it almost feel like You've been here before? How am I gonna be an optimist about this? How am I gonna be an optimist about this?  If you close your eyes, does it almost feel like nothing changed at all?	1

Run River Run	Run river run Mother's calling heavy the sun. She's tired from the storm, which is from the norm. Standing at the gate, so quiet, unafraid. But one has come, One has come.  Run river run. I hear your father's gun. He's wary from the road, the wolves and the crows. Kept him at the gates with hands full of praise. But one has come, One has one. Rushing like a spirit from a wineskin bag. Settled by your sister like it's never going back. Mother's crying out with a different kind of sadness, Sam can't shoot between a promise and a habit.  Run river run Out of dreams, into the sun. Wake river wake. There's fire coursing through your blood. There's gold in your hair, the silver line is: I know that they're scared, oh they're rushing to the wind But you won't let 'em in. No, you won't let 'em in. Rushing like a spirit from a wineskin bag. Settle by your sister with your heart in her hands. There's love in your words, she'll learn to sew. I hear her laughing, and it sounds It sounds like Home It sounds like Home It sounds like Home It sounds like Home Rushing like a spirit from a wineskin bag. Settle by your sister with your heart in her hands. There's love in your words, she'll learn to sew. I hear her laughing, and it sounds It sounds like Home It sounds like Home It sounds like Home It sounds like Home	1

7 Years	Once I was 7 years old my momma told me Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was 7 years old  It was a big big world, but we thought we were bigger Pushing each other to the limits, we were learning quicker By eleven smoking herb and drinking burning liquor Never rich so we were out to make that steady figure  Once I was 11 years old my daddy told me Go get yourself a wife or you'll be lonely Once I was 11 years old  I always had that dream like my daddy before me So I started writing songs, I started writing stories Something about that glory just always seemed to bore me Cause only those I really love will ever really know me  Once I was 20 years old, my story got told Before the morning sun, when life was lonely Once I was 20 years old (Lukas Graham!!!)  I only see my goals, I don't believe in failure Cause I know the smallest voices, they can make it major I got my boys with me at least those in favor And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I'll see you later  Once I was 20 years old, my story got told I was writing 'bout everything, I saw before me Once I was 20 years old Soon we'll be 30 years old, our songs have been sold We've traveled around the world and we're still roaming Soon we'll be 30 years old  I'm still learning about life My woman brought children for me So I can sing them all my songs And I can tell them stories Most of my boys are with me Some are still out seeking glory And some I had to leave behind My brother I'm still sorry  Soon I'll be 60 years old, my daddy got 61 Remember life and then your life becomes a better one I made a man so happy when I wrote a letter once I hope my children come and visit, once or twice a month  Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can warm me Soon I'll be 60 years old Soon I'll be 60 years old, will I think the world is cold Or will I have a lot of children who can hold me Soon I'll be 60 years old  Once I was seven years old, my momma told me Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely Once I was seven years old Once I was seven years old	0

Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. Anchor up to me, love. oh oh 	0

Coles Corner	《Coles Corner》 Richard Hawley Hold back the night from us Cherish the light for us Don't let the shadows hold back the dawn Cold city lights glowing The traffic of life is flowing Out over the rivers and on into dark I'm going down town where there's music I'm going where voices fill the air Maybe there's someone waiting for me With a smile and a flower in her hair I'm going down town where there's people The loneliness hangs in the air With no-one there real waiting for me No smile, no flower nowhere Cold city lights glowing The traffic of life is flowing Out over the rivers and on into dark Hold back the night from us Cherish the light for us Don't let the shadows hold back the dawn I'm going down town where there's music I'm going where voices fill the air Maybe there's someone waiting for me With a smile and a flower in her hair I'm going down town where there's people The loneliness hangs in the air With no-one there real waiting for me No smile, no flower nowhere Hold back the night	0

Come Close Now	I'm afraid of the space where you suffer Where you sit in the smoke and the burn I can't handle the choke or the danger Of my own foolish, inadequate words I'll be right outside if you need me Right outside What can I bring to your fire? Shall I sing while the roof is coming down? Can I hold you while the flames grow higher Shall I brave the heat and come close with you now? Can I come close now? So we left you to fight your own battle And you buried your hope with your faith 'Cause you heard no song of deliverance There on the nights that followed the wake We never thought to go with you Afraid to ask What can I bring to your fire? Shall I sing while the roof is coming down? Can I hold you while the flames grow higher Shall I brave the heat and come close with you now? Can I come close now? Lay down our plans Lay down the sure-fire fix Grief's gonna stay awhile There is no cure for this We watch for return We speak what we've heard We sit together, in the burn What can I bring to your fire? Shall I sing while the roof is coming down? Can I hold you while the flames grow higher, Shall I brave the heat and come close with you now? Can I come close now?	0

Better keep on movin＇, Doolin-Dalton, ＇Til your shadow sets you free. If you＇re fast and if you＇re lucky, You will never see that hangin＇ tree.  Well, the towns lay out across the dusty plains Like graveyards filled with tombstones, waitin＇ for the names.

Then he laughed and said, ＂I＇m goin＇＂ And so he left that peaceful life behind. Mm...  	0

Dried Out	"I rub my eyes there is nothing but the ceiling This snow in summer got me buried so deep I grab my phone reading what you have just texted me It cheers me up but then push me down more deeply This piece of music I hum Got me agitated, I have something to say I dial your ten digits Hear you and hang up right away I murmur, ""wait wait Oh you gotta wait wait now"" The heart is beating beating but I gotta wait wait now I cannot stand no more It's turning grey grey now But I keep waiting waiting waiting til' my soul dries out Remember how I used to shout it out loud Somehow I changed and start fearing the cloud s Now I gotta escape, but tell me where is the way Keep waiting for one more day Walking on streets I see everything so clearly Only my shadow is so close but blurry It's the same city as the night you hugged me My feeling for you scattered away quietly This piece of music I hum, Wakes me all up right now, I got nothing to say Stare at you for the last time, I leave myself alone in the rain. I murmur, ""wait wait oh you gotta wait wait now"" The heart's slowing down but I still gotta wait wait now I cannot stand no more It's turning grey grey now (tear comes out) but I keep waiting waiting waiting til' my soul dries out Remember how I used to dare to shout out Somehow I changed and start fearing the clouds Now I gotta escape, but tell me where is the way I'm forgetting for what I wait Now I feel, now I see, I must find my destiny Though in my eyes is just all stormy Can you see just now how paralyzed I am Hate to admit So at this point, How far I am from falling in love The second chorus and RAP how I used to dare to shout out Somehow I changed and start fearing the clouds Now I gotta escape but tell me where is the way I'm forgetting for what I wait I murmur ""ねね、ひとり寂しいよ"" The heart is beating beating but I gotta wait wait now I feel the pain pain cuz It's turning grey grey now And I keep waiting waiting waiting til you see my smile Remember how I used to dare to shout out Some day again I'm gon' shout it aloud I won't have to escape, they will all be amazed Keep waiting for one more day I murmur... dududu"	0

Hotel California	" 编曲 : Bill Szymczyk On a dark desert highway, cool wind in my hair Warm smell of colitas, rising up through the air Up ahead in the distance,I saw a shimmering light My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim I had to stop for the night There she stood in the doorway I heard the mission bell And I was thinking to myself ""This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"" Then she lit up a candle and she showed me the way There were voices down the corridor I thought I heard them say... Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face Plenty of room at the Hotel California Any time of year (Any time of year) you can find it here Her mind is Tiffany-twisted, she got the Mercedes benz She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys she calls friends How they dance in the courtyard, sweet summer sweat Some dance to remember some dance to forget So I called up the Captain ""Please bring me my wine"" He said, ""We haven't had that spirit here since nineteen sixty nine"" And still those voices are calling from far away Wake you up in the middle of the night Just to hear them say... Welcome to the Hotel California Such a lovely place (Such a lovely place) Such a lovely face They livin' it up at the Hotel California What a nice surprise (What a nice surprise) Bring your alibis Mirrors on the ceiling The pink champagne on ice And she said,""We are all just prisoners here, of our own device"" And in the master's chambers They gathered for the feast They stab it with their steely knives But they just can't kill the beast Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before ""Relax,"" said the night man ""We are programmed to receive You can check-out any time you like but you can never leave""  Producer : Bill Szymczyk Lead Vocals : Don Henley 12- & 6-String Electric Guitars : Don Felder 12-String Acoustic Guitar : Glenn Frey Electric Guitar : Joe Walsh Bass : Randy Meisner Drums & Percussion : Don Henley Backing Vocals : Don Felder / Don Henley / Glenn Frey / Joe Walsh / Randy Meisner"	0

I See Fire	Oh misty eye of the Mountain below, Keep careful watch of my brothers’ souls, And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke, Keep watching over Durin’s sons. If this is to end in fire, Then we shall all burn together, Watch the flames climb higher, Into the night. Calling out father oh, Stand by and we will, Watch the flames burn on and on, The mountainside, And if we should die tonight, We should all die together. Raise a glass of wine, For the last time. Calling out father oh, Prepare as we will, Watch the flames burn on and on, The mountainside. Desolation comes upon the sky. Now I see fire, Inside the mountain. I see fire, Burning the trees. And I see fire, Hollowing souls. I see fire, Blood in the breeze. And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me. Oh should my people fall then, Surely I’ll do the same. Confined in mountain halls, We got too close to the flame. Calling out father oh, Hold fast and we will, Watch the flames burn on and on, The mountainside. Desolation comes upon the sky. Now I see fire, Inside the mountain. I see fire, Burning the trees. And I see fire, Hollowing souls. I see fire, Blood in the breeze. And I’ll hope that you’ll remember me. And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes, For if the dark returns, Then my brothers will die. And as the sky is falling down, It crashed into this lonely town. And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screaming out. I see fire, Inside the mountains. I see fire, Burning the trees. I see fire, Hollowing souls. I see fire, Blood in the breeze. I see fire, (Oh you know I saw a city burning.) (Fire.)I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin.) Fire. And I see fire, Fire. And I see fire burn on and on, The mountainside.	0

I'm Outta Time (Album Version)	Here's a song It reminds me of when we were young Looking back at all the things we've done You gotta keep on keepin' on Out to sea Is the only place I am asleep Can get myself some piece of mind You know it's getting hard to fly If I'm to fall Would you be there to applaud Or would you hide behind the law Because If I am to go In my heart you grow And that's where you belong If I'm to fall Would you be there to applaud Or would you hide behind the law Because If I am to go In my heart you grow And that's where you belong If I'm to fall Would you be there to applaud Or would you hide behind the law Because If I am to go In my heart you grow And that's where you belong Yes I'm out of time I'm out of time I'm out of time I'm out of time I'm out of time	0

KW	 We’re floating over the district  I’m buoyed by winsome esprit  The stone arch bridge and the skyline  A tilt shift blur to the scene  Some headlights highlight the driveway  But she doesn’t turn to see  The details in our periphery  While shadows swell and recede  Droll city blocks and curbs  They all leave my head unnerved  Things felt that probably were  Thoughts I would say to her  But all light rails motor fast  One glance and a moment’s passed  View life through tinted glass  Left with one printed pass  And now it’s me and the satellites  Halfway home at night  Fly from my line of sight  I’m sad but it’s alright  (Kyle)  (Trumpet solo)	0

Love The Way You Lie	Just gonna stand there and watch me burn That's alright because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry That's alright because I love the way you lie, I love the way you lie I can't tell you what it really is I can only tell you what it feels like And right now it's a steel knife in my windpipe I can't breathe but I still fight while I can fight As long as the wrong feels right it's like I'm in flight High off her love, drunk from my hate, It's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more i suffer, I suffocate And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me She ******* hates me and I love it. Wait! Where you going? I'm leaving you No you ain't. Come back we're running right back. Here we go again It's so insane cus when its going good its going great.

Love Yourself	"For all the times that you rained on my parade And all the clubs you get in using my name You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake You think I'm crying on my own well I ain't And I didn't wanna write a song Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't, but you still hit my phone up And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back maybe you should know that My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on But now I know I'm better sleeping on my own Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself But when you told me that you hated my friends The only problem was with you and not them And every time you told me my opinion was wrong And tried to make me forget where I came from And I didn't wanna write a song Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care I don't but you still hit my phone up And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back maybe you should know that My mama don't like you and she likes everyone And I never like to admit that I was wrong And I've been so caught up in my job didn't see what's going on And now I know I'm better sleeping on my own Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself For all the times that you made me feel small I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all I never felt so low when I was vulnerable Was I a fool to let you break down my walls Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself Cause if you like the way you look that much Oh baby you should go and love yourself And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin' You should go and love yourself Producer : Benny Blanco Vocals : Justin Bieber Backing Vocals : Justin Bieber / Ed Sheeran Instrumentation & Programming : Benny Blanco Trumpet : Philip Beaudreau Engineering : Chris ""Anger Management"" Sclafani / Simon Cohen / Josh Gudwin Mixing : Josh Gudwin Additional Engineering : Chris ""Tek"" O'Ryan / Henrique Andrade Mixing Assistant : Derrick Stockwell Production Coordinator : Andrew ""McMuffin"" Luftman / Seif ""Mageef"" Hussain Recorded at Record Plant (Los Angeles, California), 2015 Mixed at Henson Recording Studios"	0

Nervous (The Ooh Song) [Mark McCabe Remix]	I promise that I'll hold you when it's cold out When we loose our winter coats in the spring Cause lately I was thinking I never told you That every time I see you my heart sings Cause we lived at the carnival in summer We scared ourselves to death on a ghost train And just like every ferris wheel stops turning Oh I guess we had an expiration date So I won't say I love you, it's too late And oooooooooh Ooooohohoooooh And oooohoooooooh Ohoooohohohoooooh Cause every time I saw you I got nervous Shivering and shaking at the knees And just like every song I haven't heard yet no I didn't know the words in front of me In front of me, and oooooooh But I don't wanna know Who'll take you home? Who'll take you home? Who'll take you home? Hoooooome And oooooohhhhh And oooooohhhhh And oooooohhhhh Oooooooohooooohoohhhh Now that you're on someone else's shoulders The winter winds are colder on my own Maybe we will meet when we get older So I won't say I love you if you don't So I won't say I love you if you don't	0

Nobody Understands	"Can't cool off. You're on fire. No cold tears gonna put you out.out out You're awake, in love, you're wired. Kissed her goodnight, now you walk by yourself.  You're so confused cause they told you, ""be careful you know she's a mess. She is a bad situation, that girl is always depressed."" But there's something you feel, they can't see it she is the one that ignites what you got inside. What you just can't hide.  The way you love her, nobody understands. The way you feel her, oh it's above their heads. The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.  You're awake and you're on fire, burning up with how you feel. Yeah she's a freak and she's a liar, but you're in love with the girl she's concealed.  You're so confused cause they told you, “her father was bad he was messed. She is a hard situation, that girl is always depressed.” Where do you go when there's no one? When no one believes in your love? It all shines out when you kiss her mouth.  The way you love her, nobody understands. The way you feel her, oh it's out of your hands The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.  The way you love her, nobody understands. The way you feel her, oh it's above their heads. The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands.  The way you love her, nobody understands. The way you feel her, oh it's above their heads. The way you bleed her, nobody understands you boy. Nobody understands. Nobody understands you boy.

Rollin' On	"Been kickin’ sawdust In these clothes For a blue moon And a red nose  The boys will put 'em up And tear 'em down We’ll wash away The dirt Just a glass a day Ain’t gonna hurt  Pretty soon we’ll move on Out of town  We pass them by Across the plains We don’t even try To catch their names It’s supper-time and their kids Are home from school They draw the shades On their shops While we go a'checking Through the props  And putting on the paint To play the fool  Then we're rollin’ on Rollin' on Feeling better Than we did last night Rollin’on rollin’ on It’s hard sometimes But pretty much it’s alright  I’ll go soft shoe When it rains I’ll go shuffle through The aches and pains ""Mr. Young-at-heart"" That’s what I try to be They all laugh And cry They get to feeling better And that is why If it was good for you Truly it was good for me  Then we're rollin’ on Rollin’ on Feeling better Than we did last night Rollin’ on rollin’ on It’s hard sometimes But pretty much it’s alright "	0
Rooftop	 I'm on the rooftop I'm on the rooftop  It's been a week So much stronger than what we are used to It's hard to sleep Like I forgot how to do it without you David Guetta,Sia - Light Headed We keep on finding ways to let it happen You'll see,I'll find you wait At door, I'm your go to  Hurts like hell Like nothing I've ever felt Why am I doing it to myself When I know that you're doubting, you're tired of trying  Up on that rooftop You told me that you don't care Turn all the lights off So where do we go from here? Up on that rooftop You told me that you don't care Turn all the lights off So where do we go from here?  I'm on the floor With my head to the wall, and I'm thinking I'm feeling torn I bet you're calling 'cause you've been out drinking I thought you said that it would never happen That you would done and I would do it again What for? Do we pretend that we not gonna miss it?  Hurts like hell Like nothing I've ever felt Why am I doing it to myself When I know that you're doubting, you're tired of trying  Up on that rooftop You told me that you don't care (you told me that you don't care) Turn all the lights off So where do we go from here? Up on that rooftop You tell me I'm wasting tears Turn all the lights off So where do we go from here?  Where do we go, where do we go Whe-whe-where do we go from here? Whe-whe-where do we go, where do we go Whe-whe-where do we go from here?  It hurts like hell Like nothing I've ever felt Why am I doing it to myself When I know that you're doubting, you're tired of trying  Up on that rooftop You told me that you don't care (You told me that you don't care) Turn all the lights off So where do we go from here? (where do we go from here?) Up on that rooftop You told me I'm wasting tears Turn all the lights off(Turn all the lights off So where do we go from here?  Where do we go, where do we go Whe-whe-where do we go from here? Whe-whe-where do we go, where do we go Whe-whe-where do we go from here? Where do we go from here?

Run	I'll sing it one last time for you Then we really have to go You've been the only thing that's right In all I've done  And I can barely look at you But every single time I do I know we'll make it anywhere Away from here  Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear  Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say  To think I might not see those eyes Makes it so hard not to cry And as we say our long goodbye I nearly do Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder  And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say Light up, light up As if you have a choice Even if you cannot hear my voice I'll be right beside you dear Louder louder And we'll run for our lives I can hardly speak I understand Why you can't raise your voice to say	0
Runaway	Strung out in the back of a black car No keys, all I got is my credit cards Now I've been here a million times Drive fast with the Beatles in the background Tell 'em take the 101 out of this town I was never one to say goodbye Every time I fall in love I go and **** it up right when it gets good Don't you think it's funny Don't you think it's funny I know I did all the ****ty things to you I said I never ever would But baby that's so like me But baby, that's so like me I don't know why I always run away I don't know why I always run away What we had was special I know what we had was special Don't know why I always run away Don't know why I always run away What we had was special I know what we had was special Strung out in the back of a black car I've got a little too good at breaking hearts I wonder if I'll ever stop Every time I fall in love I go and **** it up right when it gets good Don't you think it's funny Don't you think it's funny I know I did all the ****ty things to you I said I never ever would But baby, that's so like me Yeah Baby, that's so like me I don't know why I always run away I don't know why I always run away What we had was special I know what we had was special I don't know why I always run away I don't know why I always run away What we had was special I know what we had was special What we had was special I don't know why I always run away I don't know why I always run away What we had was special I know what we had was special I don't know why I always run away I don't know why I always run away What we had was special I know what we had was special Strung out in the back of a black car I've got a little too good at breaking hearts I was never one to say goodbye	0
Runnin’ (Lose It All)	 These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel The way I feel I'm standing still And nothing else matters now, you're not here So where are you？ I've been calling you I'm missing you  Where else can I go? Where else can I go? Chasing you Chasing you Memories turn to dust Please don't bury us I got you I got you  Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin' Ain't runnin' from myself no more Together we'll win it all I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin' Ain't runnin' from myself no more I'm ready to face it all If I lose myself, I lose it all  I've outrun the fears that chased They're standing still I'm running still I'm running still And every voice that cried inside my head forever drived Forever drived I kill the lights  Where else can I go? Where else can I go? Chasing you Chasing you  Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin' Ain't runnin' from myself no more Together we'll win it all I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin' Runnin', runnin', runnin' Ain't runnin' from myself no more I'm ready to face it all If I lose myself, I lose it all If I lose myself, I lose it all If I lose myself, I lose it all If I lose myself, I lose it all 	0
Sail Away	You led me to water but it's the ocean. I can't drink, no I can't drink of this water. But I can Sail away, Sail away, Sail away. I can Sail Away, Sail Away, I can change.  I walk like an elephant on a tightrope. I fall and you find I'm far away. Find me and let's Sail away, Sail away, Sail away. Sail Away, Sail Away, you can change. Oh but humans we rely on our past Like the nail looks to the hammer for purpose.  And sometimes I wish I was nothing more than this moment So we could be so much more than we were. We could Sail away, Sail away, Sail away. We could Sail away, Sail away, we could change. We could Sail away, Sail away, Sail away. We could Sail away, Sail away, we could change. Change change change change change change...	0
Same Mistake	So while I'm turning in my sheets And once again I cannot sleep Walk out the door and up the street Look at the stars beneath my feet Remember rights that I did wrong So here I go Hello, hello There is no place I cannot go My mind is muddy but My heart is heavy does it show I lose the track that loses me So here I go And so I sent some men to fight And one came back at dead of night Said he'd seen my enemy Said he looked just like me So I set out to cut myself And here I go I'm not calling for a second chance I'm screaming at the top of my voice Give me reason, but don't give me choice Cause I'll just make the same mistake again And maybe someday we will meet And maybe talk and not just speak Don't buy the promises cause There are no promises I keep And my reflection troubles me So here I go I'm not calling for a second chance I'm screaming at the top of my voice Give me reason, but don't give me choice Cause I'll just make the same mistake I'm not calling for a second chance I'm screaming at the top of my voice Give me reason, but don't give me choice Cause I'll just make the same mistake again So while I'm turning in my sheets Uhuh uhuh uhuh And once again I cannot sleep Uhuh uhuh uhuh Walk out the door and up the street Uhuh uhuh uhuh Look at the stars Uhuh uhuh uhuh Look at the stars falling down Uhuh uhuh uhuh And I wonder where Uhuh uhuh uhuh Did I go wrong?	0
