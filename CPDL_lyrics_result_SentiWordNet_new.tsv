'Tis May upon the mountain (Samuel Reay)	"'Tis May upon the mountain, 'Tis May- upon the lea; And in the flood, and in the wood, And with the bird, the bird and bee, And with the bird and bee, The trees are weaving rainbows, With sunbeams, buds and dew, the trees are weav- ing rainbows, With sun- beams, buds and dew, With sun- beams, buds and dew, With sun- beams, buds and dew, If of May I sing, 'tis but to bring, My ear- liest song to you, 'tis but to bring my ear- liest song, my ear- liest song to you. The cuc- koo now is telling Her name to ev'- ry grove: Each flower holds up, holds up a dewy cup, Lipful of life, of life and love, Lipful of life and love. The fra- grant breath of morning, Breathes hopes and fan- cies new, The fragrant breath of morning, Breathes hopes and fancies new, The fra- grant breath of morning, Breathes hopes and fancies new; If of them I sing, 'tis but to bring, My ear- liest song to you, 'tis but to bring my ear- liest song, my earliest song to you."	0.760827996
10 catches (Henry Purcell)	"Sir Walter, enjoying his Damsel one night, He tickl'd and pleas'd her to so great a height, that she could not contain t'wards the end of the matter, but in Rapture cry'd out, O sweet Sir Walter, O sweet Sir Walter, O sweet Sir Walter, O sweet Sir, sweet Sir Walter, O switter swatter switter swatter switter swatter switter swatter switter swatter. He that drinks is Immortal, he that drinks is Immortal, and can ne'er decay, For wine still supplys, for wine still supplys what Age wears away, how can he be Dust, how can he be Dust that moistens his Clay. If all be true that I do think, There are Five Reasons, there are Five Reasons we should Drink: Good wine, a Friend or being Dry, Or least, we should be by and by, Or any other Reason, or any other Reason; Or any other Reason why, any Reason why. Here's a health, a health, Pray let it pays about, A health that ne'er shall cease Till all our Wine is out. Therefore drink away, And never let it stand, But ply it closely round From hand to hand. And eagerly, and bravely, With courage thus persue it, For tis a health, a health, To honest Ruddy Roger Hewett. Of all all the Instruments, all all all the Instruments that are, none none none none none none none none none none none with the Viol can compare. Mark mark mark mark how the strings, how the strings their order keep with a whet whet whet whet whet whet whet whet whet whet whet whet whet and a sweep sweep sweep, But above all all all all all all all, this still abounds, With a zingle zingle zingle zingle zingle zingle zingle zingle zing, And a zit zan zounds. Room, room, room, room, room for th'express, At length here it comes; Limrick's our own, Limrick's our own, be it known, be it known to all Grums. Hark! hark! hark! The Guns of the tower ring, ring it in peals, we'll drink round the Bonfires, we'll drink round the Bonfires. Huzza, Huzza to the Bells, To our conquering Army loud Praises, loud Praises let's sing, and now Monsieur French man, and now Monsieur French man have at you, have at you next Spring. When V and I together meet, We make up 6 in House or Street, Yet I and V may meet once more And then we 2 can make but 4, But when that V from I am gone, Alas poor I can make but one. Tis women makes us love, 'tis Love that makes us sad, 'tis sadness makes us drink and drinking makes us mad. A Health, a Health to the Nut brown Lass with the Hazle Eyes She that has good Eyes has also good Thighs, let it pays, let it pays As much to the livelier Gray they're as good by night as day She that has good Eyes has also good Thighs, drink away, drink away I'll pledge Sir, i'll pledge what ho some wine here some wine to mine And to thine, to thine and to mine the Colours are Divine. But Oh the black Eyes, the black give me as much again and let it be Sack She that has good Eyes has also good Thighs and a better knack. Once in our lives, let us drink to our Wives, tho' their numbers be but small; Heav'n take the best, and the Devil take the rest, and so we shall get rid of them all; To this hearty wish, let each Man take his dish, and drink, drink, till he fall."	0.999993094
1914 (James Crawford)	"War broke and now the winter of the world with perishing great darkness closes in. The foul tornado centered at Berlin is over all the width of Europe whirled, rending the sails of progress rent or furled are all art's ensigns, verse wails. Now begin faminesof thought and feeling, love's wine's thin, the grain of human Autumn rots down hurled. For after Spring had bloomed in early Greece, and Summer blazed her glory out with Rome. An Autumn softly fell a harvest home. A slow grand age and rich with all increase but now for us wild winter and the need of sowings for new Spring, and blood for seed."	0.43621951
A Century's Penultimate (Charles Wood)	"Resplendent beams are kindling in the East â€?Awake, ye nations, to a nobler day. From port to port, from spire to spire the ray lights upon commerce freed and powers re leased, and powers released, from spire to spire the ray lights upon commerce freed and powers re leased, on commerce freed and powers released. Ye, late returned from England's royal feast, pass friend to friend a long th'Atlantic breeze, join hearts with hearts while threads that knit the seas flash love and joy of brotherhood increased, flash love and joy, and joy of brotherhood increased. So be this time remem bered, remem bered in the close and sunset of our age, our age which ebbs amain, ebbs amain. But thou, Victoria, may'st thou long sustain the burden which thy people's love bestows, the burden of a reign so rich ly blest, of all our reigns the long est and the best!"	0.981419071
A Drinking Song (Julius Benedict)	"Drink, drink, drink! and fill the night with mirth, Drink, drink, drink! Let us have a mighty measure; Drink, and fill the night with mirth, Till we quite forget the earth, And soar, and soar In the world, the world of plea- sure, And soar in the world, the world of plea- sure. Drink, and let a health go round, 'Tis the drinker's noble duty, To the eyes that shine and wound, To the eyes that shine and wound, To the mouths that bud in beau- ty, in beau- ty. Drink, drink, fill the night with mirth, Drink, drink, fill the night with mirth. Fill, fill, Fill! Fill the deepmouthed glasses high! Fill, fill, fill! Let them with the champagne tremble. Fill the deepmouthed glasses high! Like the loose wrack in the sky, Like the wrack, the loose wrack in the sky, Like the loose wrack in the sky, When the four wild winds assemble, the winds assem- ble. Here's to all the love on earth; Love, the young man's. old man's treasure. Drink, and fill your throats with mirth. Drink, and fill your throats with mirth, Drink, and drown the world in plea- sure, in plea- sure, Drink, drink, fill the night with mirth, Drink, drink, fill the night with mirth."	0.429616179
A Fairy town (Charles Hubert Hastings Parry)	"While the sun was going down, There arose a fairy town. Not the town I saw by day, Cheerless, joyless, dull and gray, But a far, fan- tastic place, Builded with ethereal grace, Shimmering in a tender mist That the slanting rays had kissed Ere they let their latest fire Touch with gold each slender spire. There no men and women be; Mermen, maidens of the sea, Combing out their tangled locks, Sit and sing among the rocks. As their ruddy harps they sound, With the seaweed twisted round, In the shining sand below See the city downward go !"	0.634466444
A Finland love song (Henry Hiles)	"Nor told my fleet reindeer The way I wished to go; But quick he bounded forth, For well my reindeer knew I've but one path on earth That path which leads to you. When summer brings, at last, Her sun that never, never sets, Than summer sun more true, more true, 'Twill never set again."	0.333360011
A Night Song (Julius Benedict)	"'Tis night, the hour of hours, When Love lies down with fold- ed wings, By Psyche in her star- less bowers, And down his fatal arrows flings down his fatal, his fatal ar- rows flings, Those bow'rs where not a sound is heard, Save only from the bridal bird. Love is here! Love is here! Love is here! Love is here! Love is here! 'Tis night! the moon is on the stream; Bright spells are on the sooth- ed sea; And Hope, the child, is gone to dream, Of plea- sures which may never be, Of pleasures which may ne- ver be! And now is haggard Care asleep, Now doth the wi- dow Sorrow smile; And now is haggard Care asleep, Now doth the widow Sorrow smile; And slaves are hush'd in slumber deep, Forgetting grief and toil awhile, And slaves are hush'd in slum- ber deep, For- get- ting grief, forgetting grief awhile!"	0.484825665
A Poison Tree (Barbara Rosen)	"Angry! I told my wrath, my wrath did end. Angry, angry at my foe: I told it not, told it, told it, told it not, my wrath did grow. my tears, my tears. And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night, Till it bore an apple bright, an apple bright. My foe beheld, beheld it^shine. He knew, knew that it was mine, was mine. Into my garden, into my garden stole. When the night had veiled the pole In the morning glad I see my foe, my foe, my foe, my foe, my foe outstretched beneath the"	0.039469626
"A Spring Song, Op. 21 no. 2 (Charles Hubert Hastings Parry)"	"It was a lo- ver and his lass, With a hey and a ho, and a hey no ni no! That o'er the green corn- field did pass In the springtime, the only pret- ty ringtime, When birds do sing Hey ding a ding, Sweet lovers love the Spring. Between the acres of the rye These pretty country folks would lie: This carol they began that hour, How that life was but a flow'r, How that life was but a flow'r. And therefore take the present time With a hey and a ho, and a hey no ni no! For love is crown- ed with the prime, In springtime, the only pret- ty ringtime, When birds do sing Hey ding a ding, Sweet lovers love the Spring."	0.860884814
A Spring song (Ciro Pinsuti)	"1. I sat be- neath the Abeles old, The meads were shot with green and gold, And under- neath my feet there rolled The little silv'ry Gad: The cu- ckoo and the thrush were sing- ing, sing- ing, singing, The sheep bells on the hills were ring- ing, ring- ing, ringing, All life was gay and glad! All life was gay and glad! All life was gay and glad! all life was gay, was gay and glad! 2. The busy babbling waterfall Melodiously kept time to all, The rich May music mystical, Toned to the fresh'ning air; Each rip'- ning bud that open, that o- pen, o- pen flies, Seemed gasp- ing with a gay, a gay sur- prise, To greet the world so fair, to greet a world so fair, to greet a world so fair! a world so fair, a world so fair! 3. O love ly, lovely, lovely Spring! O robed in sunbeams! bridegroom, king! Breathe on my heart and bid me sing, Or rather praise and pray; For em- blems are these sunny, these sun- ny, sun- ny hours, These gol- den meads, and stream, and flowers, Of everlasting May! of everlasting May, of everlasting May, of ever- lasting May!"	0.970821761
A Welsh lullaby (Charles Hubert Hastings Parry)	"Sleep, sleep, sleep, sleep ! All nature now is sleeping Her sons in sleep, their eyelids close, All living things in sweet repose are sleeping, sleep  --  ing ! Sleep, baby, sleep ! Peace o'er thee watch be keeping If from my bosom thou art torn, Low in grave I'll lie for- lorn. Sleep-  ing, Ah ! sleep-  ing, sleeping."	0.337865143
A chieftain to the Highlands bound (Robert Lucas Pearsall)	"A chieftain, to the Highlands bound, Cries, ""Boatman, do not tarry! And I'll give thee a sil- ver pound, To row us o'er the ferry."" ""Now, who be ye would cross Lochgyle This dark and stormy wa- ter?"" ""O I'm the chief of Ul- va's isle, And this Lord Ullin's daughter."" By this the storm grew loud apace, The waterwraith was shrieking; And in the scowl of heaven each face Grew dark as they were speaking. But still as wilder blew the wind, And as the night grew drear- er, Adown the glen rode arm- ed men, Their trampling sounded nearer. And still they rowed amidst the roar Of waters fast prevailing; Lord Ullin reached that fa- tal shore; His wrath was changed to wailing; For sore dismayed, through storm and shade, His child he did disco- ver; One lovely hand she stretched for aid, And one was round her lover."	0.354198608
A country pair (Thomas Weelkes)	"A country pair were walking all alone, were walking all alone, And wantonly were talking to each one, And wantonly were talking, And wantonly were talking to each one, And wantonly were talking to each one: Quoth she, I will not hate nor love thee, I will not hate nor love thee; Ah me, Ah me, what wilt thou do? what wilt thou do? Take time and thou shalt prove me, Take time and thou shalt prove me, Alas! I know not how, I know not how. What tho' I wed, I am thy friend, What tho' I wed, I am thy friend, I am thy friend, thy friend, Then kiss me, Kate, and so an end, Then kiss me, Kate, kiss me, Kate, Then kiss me, Kate, kiss me, Kate, Then kiss me, Kate, kiss me, Kate, and so an end, What tho' I wed, I am thy friend, What tho' I wed, I am thy friend, What tho' I wed, I am thy friend, Then kiss me, Kate, and so an end, Then kiss me, Kate, Then kiss me, Kate, and so an end, an end, Then kiss me, Kate, and so an end, and so an end."	0.899162725
A dialogue between Charon and Orpheus (Henry Purcell)	"Haste, haste gentle Charon haste, I prithee come, And waft me to the blest Elysium, Through whose cool shade with wand'ring souls I'll flee Till I have found the fair Eurydice. Sure he's asleep and hears me not, So ho! so ho! Awake dull man, awake! thou dost not know The pains that parted lovers undergo. I prithee come and see, 'Tis Orpheus calls. For pity's sake let me no longer stay, Each minute seems to be a lasting day. Fear not, the winds shall cease, I'll charm their rage to gentle calms of peace. Be still, still, be still, ye proud waves and your fury give o'er, Retire all ye winds, and oppose them, oppose them no more; In the dark, hollow caverns your revels go keep, Then void of disturbance, then void of disturbance the billows may sleep; And when they awake they'll be calm and appear As gentle as if the great Pluto were here."	0.178710135
A doleful deadly pang (Nicholas Strogers)	"A doleful deadly pang consumes my pining heart, which beauty's wounding shot renews with still increasing smart. Alas, I sigh and sob, I will go plead for life. Love's vapours that distil to tears, in drowning eyes be rife. Oh pity me, I die, Oh pity me, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die."	0.153857542
A garland for our fairest (John Liptrot Hatton)	"A garland for our fairest, For her we love so well, We'll weave with flowers the rarest In garden and in dell. The daisy, like her gentle heart, So modest, pure and meek; The rose to match the blushing bloom That decks her dainty cheek, that decks her dain- ty cheek, her dainty cheek. Thus blooming, sweetly blooming, Our garland bright shall go! Ah! when she sees We fain would please, Will she one smile bestow, will she one smile bestow, one smile, will she one smile bestow, will she one smile bestow, one smile bestow, one smile bestow, one smile, will she one smile bestow! The lily, like her fingers white, Whose lightest touch we prize! And violets for the liquid light, Within her dark blue eyes. But oh! no flower beneath the sun Can e'er to her impart The changeless love whose tendrils cling So closely round each heart, whose tendrils cling so closely round each heart. Thus blooming, sweetly blooming, Our garland bright shall go! Ah! when she sees We fain would please, Will she one smile bestow, will she one smile bestow, one smile, will she one smile bestow, will she one smile bestow, one smile bestow, one smile bestow, one smile, will she one smile bestow!"	0.994198086
A king there was in Thule (Robert Lucas Pearsall)	"A king there was in Thule, Right faithful to the grave, To whom his dying true- rilove A golden goblet gave. He drank out of none other, So high he did it prize; He never raised it to his lips But tears came to his eyes."	0.57596725
A psalm of life (Henry Thomas Smart)	"Tell me not, in mournful numbers, Life is but an empty dream! For the soul is dead that slumbers, And things are not what they seem, And things are not what they seem. Life is real! Life is earnest! And the grave is not its goal; Dust thou art, to dust returnest, Was not spoken of the soul, Was not spoken of the soul. Not enjoyment and not sorrow Is our destined end or way; But to act that each tomorrow Finds us farther than to- day, Finds us farther than today; Art is long, and Time is fleeting, And our hearts, though stout and brave, Still like muffled drums are beating Funeral marches to the grave, Funeral marches to the grave."	0.161960083
A rose-bud (Joachim Kelecom)	"all on a dewy morning it scents the early morning. 2. in the bush her covert nest A little linnet fondly prest, The dew sat chilly on her breast Sae early in the morning. She soon shall see her tender brood The pride, the pleasure o' the wood Amang the fresh green leaves bedew'd, Awake the early morning. 3. thou, young bird, young Jeany fair, On trembling string or vocal air Shall sweetly pay the tender care That tents thy early morning. So thou, sweet rosebud young and gay, Shalt beauteous blaze upon the day And bless the parents' evening ray That watch'd thy early morning."	0.556772839
A satyr once did run away (John Ward)	"A sa- tyr once did run away, did run away, did run away for dread, at sound of horn, at sound of horn, which he himself did blow, did blow! blow, fearing and fear- ed, fearing and feared, thus from himself he fled, he fled, deem- ing strange evil, deeming strange evil, deeming strange evil in that he did not know.

A silly sylvan (Orlando Gibbons)	"A silly Sylvan, kissing heav'nborn fire, Scorched his lips for his so fond desire: I, not so fond, but gazed whilst such fire burned, And all my heart straight into flames was turned, And all my heart straight into flames was turned, And all my heart straight into flames was turned, And all my heart straight into flames was turned, And all my heart And all my heart straight into flames was turned, was turned. His fire was stol'n, and stol'n things go amiss; and stol'n things go amiss; But I, alas! unjustly, But I, alas! unjustly, But I, alas! unjustly; for to have her, Her heav'nly fire the Gods and Graces gave her, the Gods and Graces gave her, the Gods and Graces gave her, the Gods and Graces gave her, the Gods and Graces gave her."	0.282499367
A song for the seasons (Henry Thomas Smart)	"When the merry lark doth gild With his song the summer hours, And their nests the swallows build In the roofs and tops of towers; And the golden gorseflower burns about the waste, And the maiden May returns With a pretty haste, May returns With a pretty haste, Then how mer- ry are the times, the summer times, the spring times. Now the chilly midnight cricket crieth, And all merry birds are gone, And our dream of pleasure dieth. Now the once blue laughing sky, Saddens into gray, And the frozen rivers sigh, Pining all away, Now how solemn are the times, The winter times, the night times. The winter times, the night times. Yet be merry; all around Is through one vast change revolving; Even Night who lately frowned, Is in silver dawn dissolving, is in sil- ver dawn dissolv- ing. Earth will burst her fetters, And in spring grow free, All things in the world will change, All things in the world will change, Save my love to thee, save my love to thee, all things in the world will change, save my love to thee. Then hopeful are all times, Sing then, summer, winter, spring times."	0.935146582
About the maypole (Thomas Morley)	"About the Maypole new, With glee and merriment, With glee and merriment, While as the bagpipe tooted it.

Absence (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Though long years have passed away, And joyous summer left me, Though Autumn sings her plaintive lay, Yet art thou still dear, still dear to me. me.

Adieu to the woods (Seymour John Grey Egerton)	"How beauteous liest thou sleeping, Thou fragrant, leafy hill! Through the fern the roe is leaping, And thrushes joyful trill. Ah! me, how oft I've wandered Beneath yon silv'ry pine, And dreaming, idly pon- dered, While du youth and hope were mine, how oft, how oft Your leaves sweet echoes murmur, Your whisp'ring love songs tell; I must away for ever, Sweet wood, so fare thee well! Ah! lovely, lonely moments, Where shall I find ye now? In sorrow and in darkness, My silent tears o'erflow. The wood is calmly lying, The deer is 'neath the fern; Whence comes yon gentle sigh- ing, To soothe my sad con- cern? yon gentle sighing?

Allan Water (Henry Elliot Button)	"On the banks of Allan Water, When the sweet spring tide did fall, Was the miller's lovely daughter Fairest of them all. For his bride a soldier sought her, And a winning tongue had he, On the banks of Allan Water None so gay as she. On the banks of Allan Water, When brown autumn spreads its store, There I saw the miller's daughter, But she smiled no more. For the summer grief had brought her, And a soldier false was he; On the banks of Allan Water, None so sad as she. On the banks of Allan Water, When the wintry snow fell fast, Still was seen the miller's daughter; Chilling blew the blast.

Allen-a-Dale (Charles Harford Lloyd)	"AllenaDale has no faggot for burning, AllenaDale has no furrow for turning, AllenaDale has no fleece for the spinning, Yet Al- lenaDale has red gold for the winning, AllenaDale has red gold for the winning, Come, read me a riddle! come, hearken my tale! And tell me the craft of bold AllenaDale. The Baron of Ravensworth prances with pride, And he views his domain upon Arkindale side, The mere for his net, and the land for his game, The chase for the wild, and the park for the tame; Yet the fish of the lake, and the deer of the vale, Are less free to Lord Dacre than AllenaDale. AllenaDale was ne'er belted a knight, Though his spur be as sharp and his blade be as bright; AllenaDale is no baron or lord; Yet twenty tall yeomen will draw at his word; And the best of the nobles his bon- net will vail, Who at Rerecross on Stanmore meets Allen- adale. The mother, she asked of his household and home. "" 'Tis the blue vault of heaven with its crescent so pale, And with all its bright spangles,"" said AllenaDale. The father was steel, and the mother was stone; They lifted the latch, and they bade him be gone. But loud on the morrow their wail and their cry: He had laughed on the lass with his bonny black eye. And she fled to the forest to hear a love tale, and she fled to the forest to hear a love tale, and she fled to the forest to hear a love tale: And the youth it was told by, the youth it was told by, the youth it was told by was AllenaDale, And she fled to the forest to hear a love tale, and she fled to the forest to hear a love tale: And the youth it was told by, the youth it was told by was AllenaDale."	0.671219549
Already snow has fallen (Robert Franz)	"Already snow has fallen, Though winter is not come; No farther can I tra- vel, The way that leads me home. Alas! my home is roofless, Decayed and quite grown old, Nor door nor window remain- ing, Its chambers dark and cold.

Ambitious love (William Byrd)	"Ambitious love hath forced me to aspire, the beauties rare which do adorn thy face: Thy modest life yet bridles my desire, whose severe law doth promise me no grace.

Proceed then in this desperate enterprise, with good advice, and follow love thy guide, that leads thee to thy wished Paradise, to thy wished Paradise, Paradise.

At first the mountain rill (George Alexander Macfarren)	"At first the mountain rill is weak, And from its prison scarce can break; Then each pebble in the way Seems e- nough its course to stay.

At first, at first the mountain rill is weak, But spreading as it glides along, A torrent strong, its path is broad and free, As it bounds, as it bounds, bounds into the sea. Thus love is oft so weak at first, That e'ne the heart in which 'tis nursed Scarcely can its presence feel; But its power will soon reveal; And so mighty is its force, Nothing can restrain its course. Riches, honours, what are they? Love through all will find a way, Nothing can restrain its course, Love through all will find a way.

Beauty Concealed (CèŒ…sar Antonovich Cui)	"Where enwrapp'd in sleep the forest sighs the forest sighs, There a mute, untrodden valley lies, Spellbound by the tempest's pow'rs, and lost 'mid dark woods. There the ranks of gnarled willows grow, By the margin of a sluggish stream, There the pallid lilies bloom and dream, Where the silent, winding waters flow. There the stunted silver birches stand, Scatter'd o'er the wild and marshy heath, Yonder, shutting in the lonely land, spreads a forest, dark and sad as death, sad as death. But such spots bear no message to the soul that's lost in care; Only Nature's true adept may guess All their strange and secret loveliness, Na.ture's true adept may guess All their strange and secret loveliness."	0.48928787

Desire (Mark Chapman)	"bright eyes, sweet lips, with many fevers fill The young blood, running wildly, as it must; but lips and eyes beget a strange distrust.

An ecstacy of fumbling, fitting the clumsy helmets just in time; but someone still was yelling out and stumbling, and flound'ring like a man in fire or lime.... Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light, as under a green sea I saw him drowning. In all my dreams, before my helpless sight, he plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning. If in some smothering dreams you too could pace behind the wagon that we flung him in, and watch the white eyes writhing in his face, his hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin; if you could hear, at every jolt, the blooDD come GarGling from the froth corrrupted lungs, Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, my friend, you would not tell with such high zest to children ardent for some desperate glory, the old lie: Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori."	0.038009028

Each lovely grace (William Corkine)	"Each lovely grace my Lady doth possess, Let all men view, and in their view admire, In whose sweet breast all virtuous thoughts do rest, Zealous to pity, Chaste in her own desire, And to make up a rare and worthy creature, Both wife,and chaste,and fair in form and feature, Enter but into thought of her perfection, Thou wilt confess, thou wilt confess, thou wilt confess, and in confessing prove, Hownone deserves like praise, nor yet like love."	0.674748191

Echo (CèŒ…sar Antonovich Cui)	"With in the wood a tricksy imp's abiding, The Echosprite. With mocking laughter there he lurks in hiding, Where trees make night. He wears a jerkin, so they tell all woven of forest grasses green, A jaunty cap becomes right well, His wind toss'd locks of golden sheen. To mortals' calls he loves to be replying, Conceal'd from sight. We hear his voice, his presence ne'er descrying. Ah! thou Echosprite, We hear thee sprite thy presence ne'er descrying. Thou sprite, Tho' out of sight, We hear thee sprite, Tho'out of sight."	0.650114652

Echoes (John Baptiste Calkin)	"Still the angel stars are shining, Still the rippling waters flow, But the angel voice is silent, That I heard so long ago. Hark! the echoes murmur low, Long ago! Still the wood is dim and lonely, Still the plashing fountains play, But the past and all its beauty, Whither has it fled away? Hark! hark! the mournful echoes say, Fled away, Fled away. 2. But the bird of night complaineth, (Now, indeed, her song is pain,) Visions of my happy hours, Do I call and call in vain? Hark! the echoes cry again, All in vain! Cease, oh echoes, mournful echoes, Once I loved your voices well; Now my heart is sick and weary, Days of old, a long farewell! Hark! Hark! the echoes sad and dreary, Cry farewell, fare- well!"	0.153008607

The bees boom past, the white moths rise, the white moths rise Like spirits from the ground; The gray flies hum their weary tune, the gray flies hum their weary seen, Is flitting round atune, A distant, dreamlike sound, a distant dreamlike sound, a dreamlike sound; And far, far off to the slumb'rous eve; Bayeth an old guardhound."	0.727393671
Evening glow on the woods (Franz Wilhelm Abt)	"Beside the wood a pinetree stands, Whose boughs are mer- rily wa- ving, Two birds on the top are pois- ing themselves, The wind that rocks them bra- ving.

And now the sun's fastfading beams Are from the wood disappear- ing; The stillness of night over all things comes, Her peace and bless- ing are near- ing.

Four prairie songs of Sandburg (Peter Bird)	"I was born on the prairie and the milk of its wheat the red of its clover, eyes of its women, gave a song, gave a song. I am one of your boys. I have loved the prairie as a man with a heart shot full of pain over love. Ah nothing so much as one more sunrise or a sky moon of fire; river moon of water. I speak of new cities and new people. I tell you yesterday is a wind gone down, I tell you there is nothing in the world Ocean of tomorrows, a sky of tomorrows. I am the brother Tomorrow is a day. I lean on an ash and watch the lights fall, the red ember glow, and three muskrats swim west in a fan of ripples on a sheet of river gold. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Only the peace of a dog head on a barn floor, And the new corn shovel'd in bushels Here a dog head dreams. Not any hate, not any love. Not any thing but dreams. Brother of dusk and umber. Oh We sleep, In the cool moist loam, To the lull of years that pass, And the break of stars. The soft warm loam, We rise, rise: To shape of rose leaf, Of face and shoulder. We stand, then, To a whiff of life, Lifted to the silver of the sun Over and out of the loam A day. A day. This flower is repeated out of old winds, out of old times. This flower is repeated out of old winds, out of old times. Ah Ah, Ah, Ah. Ah. Oh, windflowers so fresh, Oh, beautiful leaves, here now again. The domes over fall to pieces. The stones under fall to pieces. Rain and ice wreck the works. Ah The wind Ah windAh keep, leaves Ah. The wind young and strong lets these last longer than stones."	0.658366036
From Citheron the warlike boy is fled - There careless thoughts are freed - If Love be just (William Byrd)	"And smiling sits upon a virginâ€™s lap, a virginâ€™s lap, thereby to train poor misers to the trap, whom beauty draws with fancy to be fed, with fancy to be fed, to be fed, and when desire, and when desire, with eager looks is led, then from her eyes, the arrow flies, feathered with flame, armed with a golden head, armed with a golden head, armed with a golden head. There careless thoughts are freed of that flame, wherewith her thralls are scorched to the heart, to the heart, if love would so, if love would so, would God the enchanting dart, might once return and burn, might once return and burn from whence it came, from whence it came, not to deface, not to deface of beautyâ€™s work the frame, but by rebound it might be found, it might be found, what secret smart I suffer by the same, by the same, what secret smart I suffer by the same, I suffer by the same. If love be just, then just is my desire, and if unjust, why is he called a God? O God, O good, O good, O just, reserve thy rod, reserve thy rod to chasten those that from thy laws retire, retire, retire, but choose aright, but choose aright, good love I thee require, require, the golden head, not that of lead, of lead, not that of lead, her heart is frost and must dissolve by fire, her heart is frost and must dissolve by fire, her heart is frost, and must dissolve by fire, dissolve by fire, and must dissolve by fire, by fire."	0.996705981
Frost in the Fall (Peter Bird)	"Oh Oh Oh Oh The road is forlorn all day, Oh Ah The roadside flowers, too wet for the bee, Expand their blooms in vain. Oh Oh Oh All song of the woods is crush'd like some wild, easily shatter'd rose. Ah There is the gale to urge behind And bruit our singing down, Ah What matter if we go clear to the west, and come not through dryshod? Wilding brooch shall wet your breast: the rainfresh goldenrod. Ah But it seems like the sea's return Ah Ah And it seems like the time when, after doubt, Our love came back amain. Ah My love; In the rain. O hush'd October morning mild, Leaves have ripen'd to the fall; Ah. The crows above the forest call; Tomorrow they may form and go. Ah Begin the hours of this day slow, Make the day seem to us less brief. Beguile us in the way you know: Release one leaf at break of day; At noon release another leaf; One Ah from our trees, one far away; one far away; Retard the sun with gentle mist; Enchant the land with amethyst. Slow. For the grapes' sake, if they were all, Whose leaves already are burnt with frost, Whose clus...cluster'd ter'd fruit fruit must must else be be lost, lost, For the grapes' ...grapes' sake, along the wall. Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Oo Ah The leaves are all dead on the ground, Save those that the oak is keeping. To ravel them one by one And let them go scraping and creeping Out over the crusted snow When others are sleeping. And the dead leaves lie huddled and still, No longer blown hither and thither; The last lone aster is gone; The flowers of witchhazel wither; flowers wither; The heart is still aching to seek, But the feet question 'Whither?' man Was Ah it ever less than a treason To go with the drift of things, Ah Ah Ah Ah Ah.

It is not the tear (Charles Villiers Stanford)	"It is not the tear, at this moment shed, When the cold turf has just been laid o'er him, That can tell how belov'd was the friend that's fled, Or how deep in our hearts we deplore him, Tis the tear, thro' a long day wept, 'Tis life's whole path o'er shaded; 'Tis the one remembrance, fondly kept, When all higher griefs have faded. Thus his memory, like some holy light, Kept alive in our hearts, will improve, them, For worth shall look fairer, and truth more bright, When we think how he lived but to love them. And no fresher flowers the sod perfume Where buried saints are lying, So our hearts shall borrow a sweet'ning bloom From the image he left there in dying."	0.918142797

Now to our home, the proud mansion of Aspen, Bend we gay victors trium- phant away; There each fond damsel her gallant youth clasping, Shall wipe from his forehead the stains of the fray.

King Witlaf's drinking horn (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Witlaf, a King of the Saxons, Ere yet his last he breathed, To the merry monks of Croyland His drink- ing horn bequeathed, That, whenever they sat at their revels, And drank from the golden bowl, They might remember the donor, And breathe a prayer for his soul. So sat they once at Christmas, And bade the gob- let pass; In their beards the red wine glistened Like dew- drops in the grass, Like dewdrops in the grass, Like dew- drops in the grass. They drank to the saints and martyrs, Of the dismal days of yore, And as soon as the horn was empty, They remem- bered one saint more, And the reader droned from the pulpit, Like the murmur of many bees, The legend of good Saint Guthlac, And Saint Ba- sil's ho- milies, Till the great bells of the Convent From their prison in the tower. Guthlac and Bartholomaeus Proclaimed the midnight hour, Proclaimed the midnight hour, Proclaimed the midnight hour. And the yulelog cracked in the chimney, And the Abbot bowed his head, And the flamelets flapped and flickered, But the Abbot was stark and dead; Yet still in his pallid fingers He clutched the gol- den bowl, In which, like a pearl dissolving, Had sunk and dissolved his soul. But not for this their revels The jovial monks forbore; For they cried, ""Fill high the goblet! We must drink to one saint more, must drink to one saint more, must drink to one saint more."""	0.817256628

More life (Walter Cecil Macfarren)	"When springtime prospers in the grass, And fills the vale with tender bloom, And light winds whisper as they pass, Of summer days to come In spite of all the joys she brings, the joys she brings To flood and field, To flood and field, To flood and field, to hill and grove, This, this is the song my spirit sings, More light, more life, more love! And when, her time fulfilled, she goes, So gently from her vernal place, And meadows wide, and woodland glows With sober sum- mer grace; When on the stalk the ear is set, With all the harvest bright, with all the harvest promise bright, With all the harvest pro- mise bright, My spirit sings the old song yet, More love, more life, more light! When stubble takes the place of grain, And shrunken streams steal low along, And all the faded woods complain, Like one who suffers some great wrong: When fires are lit, and ev'- ry- where, and ev'- rywhere The pleasures of the household rife, The pleasure of the household rife, My song is solemnised to prayer, More love, more light, more life!"	0.760107969

O 'twas thus in life's gay morning, Ere my bosom harboured care, Ev'ry scene with joy adorning, ev'ry scene with joy adorning, Love shone brightly, sweetly there! If a momentary sadness Chanced upon my breast to light, Beams of glad- ness, Put the dreary cloud to flight. Now 'tis past yet while I wander In the thorny path of woe, Doomed on parted joys to ponder, Sadly sighing as I go; Oft in mem'ry's glass reviewing, Ev'ry spot my feet have trod, Fancy, each loved scene renewing, Lights with hope the future road; Fancy, each loved scene renewing, Lights with hope, Still lights with hope, with hope the fu- ture road."	0.764844268

Night song (Franz Wilhelm Abt)	"Darkness rests on wood and meadow, Perfect peace now reigns supreme; Yet, with halfforgotten sorrow, Sings a bird, as in a dream. Silent night, a gentle warning To my soul is borne by thee; I too feel, with blest foreboding, There is peace awaiting me, I too feel, with blest forboding, There is peace awaiting me. Peace, O peace! an eager longing Fills my poor forsaken heart; Up to heav'n I gaze, entreating, While the tears un- bidden start. On my eyelids be thou falling, Sweet repose, with friendly might, Send thy dew once more to bless me, Thou enchanting summer night, Send thy dew once more to bless me, Thou enchanting summer night."	0.779383589

Nightfall in Winter (Charles Hubert Hastings Parry)	"Cold is the air, The woods are bare And brown; the herd Stand in the yard. The frost doth fall; And round the hill The hares move slow; The homeward crow, Alone and high, Crosses the sky All silently. The quick streams freeze; The moving trees Are still; for now No breeze will blow; The wind has gone With the day, down, And clouds are come Bearing the gloom. The yellow grass, In the clear glass Of the bright pool Grows soft and dull. The water's eye That held the sky Now gazes quite; And now the light On the cold hill Fadeth, until The giant mass Doth seem to pass From near to far; The clouds obscure The sky with gloom. The night is come, The night is come."	0.250505241

Not for me the lark is singing (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Not for me the lark is singing, Not for me the sun shines fair, Not for me the bells are ringing, And the lilies scent the air, the lilies scent the air. For my little bird is silent, And my sun has set in gloom, And the parting bell has sounded For my lily in her bloom, my lily in her bloom. Not for me the lark is singing, Not for me the sun shines fair, Not for me the bells are ringing, And the lilies scent the air, the lilies scent the air. Bird and blossom both are faded, Both alike are dead to me; Sunny mem'ries now are shaded As by mists the evening sea, by mists the eve- ning sea, Bird and blossom, light and shadow, All in life to her were dear; And the bells made mirthful music Ever to her list'ning ear, ever to her list'ning ear. Not for me the lark is singing, Not for me the sun shines fair, Not for me the bells are ringing, And the lilies scent the air, the lilies scent the air. Mournful heart, control thy sorrow, Deem not hope for ever fled; Birds will blithely sing tomorrow, Though this bird of thine be dead, this bird of thine be dead. Little checked by lamentation, Time's renewing currents flow; And the brightest flowers will blossom Where thy lily lies below, where thy lily lies below. Then for thee the lark is singing, Then for thee the sun shines fair, Then for thee the bells are ringing, And the lilies scent the air, the lilies scent the air."	0.518883865

One morning sweet in May (Henry David Leslie)	"While walking near a river clear One morning sweet in May, When hawthorn trees perfumed the breeze, And birds sang on each spray; A maiden fair with golden hair, By chance that way did pass; Her queenly grace and lovely face, No god- dess could surpass.

At her I gazed, I was amazed, Her beauty was so rare, And with love sweet my heart did beat For this dear maid so fair.

Others come and pass before me, But I lift not up mine eyes; From afar I feel thy coming, Ere thy form, Ere thy form I recog- nise, thy form I re- cognise. But when thou dost stand beside me, Indistinct thy form appears, For with joy and pain and trembling, Are mine eyes suffused with tears, suffused with tears, For with joy and pain and trembling, are mine eyes suffused with tears."	0.478363454

The bards may go down to the place of their slumbers, The lyre of the charmer be hushed in the grave; Shall kindle the hearts of our faithful and brave. 'Twill waken and echo in souls deep and lonely, Like voices of reeds by the summer breeze fanned; 'Twill call up a spirit of freedom, when only Her breathings are heard in the songs of our land. The springtime may come with the song of her glo- ry, To bid the green heart of the fo- rest rejoice; But the pine of the mountain, though blast- ed and hoa- ry, And rock in the de- sert can send forth a voice.

Come thou and brim the meadow streams, And soften all the hills with mist, O falling dew, from burning dreams, By thee shall herb and flower, shall herb and flower be kissed, shall herb and flower be kissed, be kissed, be kissed, O gentle, gentle summer summer rain, O gentle summer rain, gentle rain."	0.262842272
Sunset (Francesco Berger)	"Sunset in the silver bay; Darker shadows, darker shadows, dar- ker sha- dows round us play. O'er the distant scene Falls the glorious setting sun, Who can tell what he hath seen, what he hath seen Since the day be- gun? Steeped in dew each flow'ret weeps, 'Tis the sacred hour of rest, La- bour's o'er, and Sorrow sleeps. When the busy day is done, the busy day is done, Peace and sweet repose be ours, Sweet re- pose, Tran- quil as set- ting sun."	0.630905286
Sunshine through the clouds (Jacques-Nicolas Lemmens)	"When o'er the peaceful, scent- ed glade, The angry storm has swept, The angry storm has swept; And drooping hangs each ten- der blade, As though the flowers wept, the flowers wept, As though the flowers wept, the flowers wept; How gloriously awak- ing, Where frowning, frowning va- pour crowds, O'er mist and gloom comes break- ing, comes break- ing, The sunshine through the clouds, The sunshine through the clouds, The sunshine through the clouds! Sparkling and flashing, All like a jewelled stream; The light of joy and beauty In ev'ry golden beam! The light of joy and beauty In ev'ry golden beam! When o'er the tender, sad- dened heart The storm of grief has past, The storm of grief has past; Each breath a sigh, each thought a smart, It hopes to be the last, to be the last, It hopes to be the last, to be the last! How joyously awaking, Where sorrow's, sorrow's gloom enshrouds, O'er fear and doubt comes break- ing, comes break- ing, The sunshine through the clouds, The sunshine through the clouds, The sunshine through the clouds! Sparkling and flashing, All like a jewelled stream; The light of love and comfort In ev'ry golden beam! The light of love and comfort In ev'ry golden beam! There's not a day but has its grief, An hour but has its smile, An hour but has its smile; And ah! how sweet is the be- lief That pain lasts but awhile! lasts but awhile! That pain lasts but awhile! lasts but awhile! And when the heart is aching, As sadness, sadness o'er it crowds, O'er fear and doubt comes break- ing, comes break- ing, The sunshine through the clouds, The sunshine through the clouds, The sunshine through the clouds! Sparkling and flashing, All like a jewelled stream; The light of joy and beauty In ev'ry golden beam! The light of joy and beauty In ev'ry golden beam!"	0.001782005

The Belfry Tower (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Oh, the belfry tow'r has a coat of green, Where the little birds build the leaves be- tween: And they twitter, twitter, twitter, And they twitter around its old grey pate, And they twitter around its old grey pate, Their little love songs, each one to its mate, each one to its mate. Yet the belfry tow'r I could dream alway Has its secrets hid which it won't betray; has its secrets hid which it won't betray; For a hundred years its bells have chim'd While the mosses crept, and the ivy climb'd. Merrily peal the jingling bells, When of human joy their music tells! the jingling bells, When of human joy their music tells! When a babe was born to a high de- gree, It was then they clatter'd out noi- si- ly: And be sure they clamour'd, And be sure they clamour'd with all their pow'r, And be sure they clamour'd with all their pow'r, When vows were pledg'd in the bridal hour, in the bridal hour. When a monarch was crown'd, or a battle won, They waked the echoes till the set of sun, They waked the echoes till the set of sun. With the deep bass note and the boom- ing roar Of the guns that answer'd from shore to shore. Clatt'ring merrily, merrily, peal the bells, When a nation's joy their music tells! The merry bells, When a nation's joy their music tells! But the belfry tow'r has its work of woe, When the passing bell tolls long and slow. While the ivy climbs, while the ivy climbs, and the mosses creep, While the ivy climbs, and the mosses creep, We must bow to sorrow, and sometimes weep, and sometimes, weep; And it makes us dream of the days gone by, The old grey tow'r 'neath the twilight sky, The old grey tow'r 'neath the twilight sky, Though its summer suit is fresh- ly green, And the little birds build the leaves between. Slow and solemnly toll the bells, When of woe and death their music tells! of rest and peace, When the stir and the clang of the wor- kers cease; And the church bells ringing, and the church bells ringing on Sabbath morn, And the church bells ringing on Sabbath morn And joy to the blest, and comfort the lorn, and comfort the lorn. For they waken the heart to faith and love, While they lure our thoughts to a world above, While they lure our thoughts to a world above. And it seems so meet that the little birds sing Round the belfry tow'r while the church bells ring. Tenderly peal the Sabbath bells, For of joy and love their music tells! the Sabbath bells, For of joy and love their music tells!"	0.994116483

Awake! awake! the quarry waits, The horns are blithe- ly sounding; The hounds and steeds across the meads Would now be swiftly bounding. Awake! awake! The hounds and steeds across the meads Would now be bound- ing. Awake! the quarry waits, The horns are blithely sounding! Awake! awake! awake! Behold! the antler'd quarry roves Amid the bush and bracken, Behold! His rein should ne- ver slacken, His rein should ne- ver slacken! So come and join the sturdy chase O'er ev'ry hill and hollow; Not lagging, but at lightning pace, The nimble deer we'll follow. Behold! the antler'd quar- ry roves! Awake! awake! the quarry waits, The horns are blithe- ly sounding; The hounds and steeds across the meads Would now be swiftly bounding. Awake! awake! The hounds and steeds across the meads Would now be bound- ing. Awake! the quarry waits, The horns are blithely sounding! The hounds and steeds across the meads Would now be swift- ly bound- ing, Ah!

The years steal on, and day by day Her native charms ex- pand, Her round face meets the summer ray Like the rose of her own blest land; There's mu- sic in her laugh- ing tone, A gold gleam through her curl, And beauty makes her chosen throne On the brow of the English girl, on the brow of the English girl. She is standing now a happy bride By the holy altar rail, While the sacred blush of a maiden's pride Gives a tinge to the snow- y veil; Her eye of light is a dia- mond bright, Her inno- cence the pearl, And these are the rich- est bri- dal gems That are worn by the English girl, that are worn by the English girl."	0.931905206

My Child you're deceived by the vapours of night, My Child you're deceived by the vapours of night. My father, my Father, and dost thou not hear, What words the Erl King whispers soft in my ear? Oh hush thee my Child, set thy bosom at ease; Thou hear'st but the willows when murmurs the breeze, Thou hear'st but the willows when murmurs the breeze. My Father, my Father, and dost thou not see The Erl King and his Daughter are waiting for me Oh shame thee, my Infant, 'tis fear makes thee blind, Thou see'st the dark willows which wave in the wind; Thou see'st the dark willows that wave in the wind. My Father, my Father, oh hold me now fast, He pulls me, he hurts me, he'll have me at last.

A finer light is in her eye, Than that whose fit- ful shining Now thrills her soul with sudden joy, Now sets it to repining! mm For on the Ganges' sacred stream, Her fateful lamp is floating, And as it flames, or as it dies, Shall be her lover's doating. A thousand stars are in the sky, Like gems on hid- den fingers: But eye unused to upward gaze, On lurid light still lingers! mm Oh, not for us, with idle thought, To scorn the Indian maiden; We too may watch our earthen lamps, With lotus wreath'd and laden!

The witch, she gave him armour white, She formed him like a gallant knight, Of water clear next formed her hand, A steed, whose housings were of sand. The Water King then swift he went; To Mary's church his course he bent, He bound his courser to the door, And paced the churchyard three times four. The lovely maid she smil'd aside, ""Oh! would I were the white chief's bride!"" Oh! had some spirit deign'd to sing: ""Your partner is the Water King!"" The maid had hate and fear confessed, And spurned the hand which then she pressed, But nothing giving cause to think, how near she strayed to danger's brink, Still on she went, 'til hand in hand, The lovers reached the yellow sand. ""Stop! stop! my love! the waters blue, E'en now my shrinking foot bedew."" ""Stop! stop! for God's sake! stop! for oh! The waters o'er my bosom flow."" Scarce was the word pronounced, when knight and courser vanished, knight and courser vanished from her sight! She shrieks, but shrieks in vain, shrieks, but shrieks in vain, For high the wind dull, dull the cry, dull the cry, The billows dash, the billows dash, And o'er their hapless victim wash. Three times while struggling with the stream, The lovely maid was heard to stream, The lovely maid was heard to scream, But when the tempest's rage was o'er, The lovely maid was seen no more, but when the tempest's rage was o'er, the lovely maid was seen no more."	0.302555238

Let o- thers freeze with an- gling reeds, And cut their legs with shells and weeds, Or cu- rious traitors, sleave- silk flies, Bewitch poor fishes' wand'ring eyes. For thee thou need'st no such deceit, For thou thyself art thine own bait: That fisn that is not catched there- by, Alas! is wiser far than I, Come, live with me and be my love, Come, live with me and be my love, Come, live with me and be my love, and be my love."	0.993304167

Golden grows the fruit so fair, Nodding on the dark green spray, And the flowers blooming there, Winter marks not for his prey, Winter marks not for his prey. But a torrent bars my way: Fierce its angry billows roll, And the menace of its spray, With a shud- der fills my soul. Lo! a boat reels to and fro, But alas! the pilot fails Bold and fearless in it go, Life breathes on its swelling sails. Heav'n ne'er gives a pledge to man, Strong in faith then thou must dare; Thee nought but a wonder can To the Land of Won- ders bear, to the Land of Wonders, the Land of Wonders bear."	0.960621367
The lark (John Liptrot Hatton)	"The grass is wet with shining dews, Their silver bells hang on each tree; Breathe incense forth unceasingly, breathe incense forth unceasingly; The mavis pipes The throstle glads And merrily the blithesome lark Sa- lutes the rosy face of morn. 'Tis early prime, And hark, hark, hark, His mer- ry chime, Chirrups the lark, Chirrup, chirrup, he heralds in The jolly sun with matin hymn. Come, come, O come, and maydews shake, In pailfuls from each drooping bough; That breaks upon thy young cheek now, that breaks upon thy young cheek now. O'er hill and dale, Aurora's smiles With earth it is brave holiday, In heaven it looks high jubilee: And it is right, For mark, mark, mark, How, bathed in light, Chirrups the lark, Chirrup, chirrup, he upward flies, Like holy thoughts to cloudless skies."	0.684447856
The lass of Richmond hill (James Hook)	"On Richmond hill there lives a lass, More bright than Mayday morn, Whose charms all other maids sur- pass, A rose without a thorn; This lass so neat, with smile so sweet, Has won my right goodwill, I'd crowns resign To call her mine, Sweet lass of Richmond hill, sweet lass of Richmond hill, sweet lass of Richmond hill, I'd crowns resign to call her mine, sweet lass of Richmond hill."	0.885562376
The last night of the year (Arthur Sullivan)	"The good old year's awaning, awaning. The good old year's awan- ing; He brought us care and woe, But we'll forgive the wrong he wrought, the wrong he wrought, But we'll forgive the wrong he wrought, Before we let him go. We will not look around us For those who once were here, But count the good that's left us still, On the last night of the year, But count the good that's left us still, On the last night of the year. He carried off their riches From some in springtime proud, But summer's heavy heart- ed ones He made to laugh aloud, But summer's heavy hearted ones He made to laugh aloud; And though his months went over With many a sigh and tear, We will not stay to tell them now, On the last night of the year, We will not stay to tell them now, On the last night of the year. He broke full many a friendship And many a lover's vow! But he hath let us meet a- gain, So we'll not blame him now, But he hath let us meet again, So we'll not blame him now, Nor look behind nor forward In sorrow or with fear. But send the cup of hope about On the last night of the year, But send the cup of hope about On the last night of the year."	0.099662247
The letter (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Three weary days have passed away, And still I sing a mournful lay, Because my love is far away, And I have had no letter.

O, happy heart! that can rejoice In simple ef- forts to be glad; And hear sweet sounds in ev'ry voice As if it silent music had, music had. Laughter, a sigh, a snatch of song, Lightning a cloud in dappled heav'n, A hundred things the liveday long, the liveday long, As chords of joy to thee are giv'n, As chords of joy to thee are giv'n, to thee, to thee are giv'n. O light of life! 'tis ours to warm Thy little spark into a blaze; That from our hearts the darkling storm May redden in the joyful rays, joyful rays.

'Twas roaming careless o'er the hills, As sunlight left the sky, That first I met this moorland maiden Bring- ing home her kye! bringing home her kye: Her native grace, her lovely face, The pride of art out- shone, I wondered that so sweet a flower Should blos- som, should blos- som thus alone. Alas, that ever I should meet Those beaming eyes of blue, That round about my thoughtless heart Their strong enchant- ment threw, their strong enchantment threw. I could not dream that falsehood lurked In such an an- gel smile; I could not fly the fate that lured With such a lovely, with such a lovely wile. And when she comes into the vale, To try her beauty's power, She'll leave a spell on many a heart, That flut- tered free before, that flut- tered free before.

The second, with a bearded face, Stood sing- ing in the marketplace, And stirred with accents deep and loud The hearts, the hearts, of all the list'ning crowd, of all the list'ning crowd. A grey old man, the third and last, Sang in cathe- drals dim and vast, sang in cathe- drals dim and vast, While the majes- tic or- gan rolled Contrition, contrition from its mouths of gold. For those who heard the singers three, Disputed which the best, the best might be, disputed which the best might be; For still their music seemed to start Discordant echoes in each heart, discordant echoes in each heart. But the great Mas- ter said, I see no best in kind, but in degree; To charm, to strengthen, and to teach. These are the three great chords of might, And he whose ear is tuned aright, and he whose ear is tuned aright Will hear no discord, will hear no discord in the three, But the most perfect har- mony, but the most perfect, harmony, but the most perfect har- mo- ny."""	0.993922028

Blow, let us hear, Blow, let us hear, the pur- ple glens re- plying, Blow, bugle, Answer, echoes, Blow, bugle, Answer, echoes, Blow, bugle, Answer, echoes, Blow, Blow."	0.292554669
The starlings (George Alexander Macfarren)	"1. Early in spring- time, on raw and windy mornings, Beneath the freezing houseeaves I heard the starlings sing, Ah dreary March month, Is this then a time for building wearily? wearily, wea- rily, Sad, sad to think that the year is but begun, Sad, sad, but begun, the year is but begun. 2. Late in the Au- tumn, on still and cloudless eve- nings, Among the golden reedbeds I heard the starling sing. Ah! that sweet March month, When we and our mates were courting merrily? merrily, mer- rily, Sad, sad to think that the year is all but done, all, all, all but done, the year is all but done."	0.436449957
The stars are with the voyager (Walter Cecil Macfarren)	"The stars are with the voyager, Wherever he may sail, The moon is constant to her time, The sun will never fail; But follow, follow, round the world, the sea, So love is with the lover's heart, Wherever he may be, So love is with the lo- ver's heart, So love is with the lo- ver's heart. Wherever he may be the stars Must daily lose their light, The moon will veil her in the shade, The sun will set at night, The sun may set but constant love will shine So dull night is never night, And day is brighter day, So that dull night is ne- ver night, And day, and day is bright- er day."	0.889221519
"The stars are with the voyager, Op.8, no.7 (Alexander Campbell Mackenzie)"	"The stars are with the voyager, Wherever he may sail, The moon is constant to her time, The sun will never fail, the sun will never fail. Then follow, follow round the world, The green earth and the sea; So love is with the voyager, Wherever he may be, So love is with the lover's heart, Wherever he may be, wherever he may be, he may be. Wherever he may be, The stars must daily lose their light, The moon will veil her in the shade, The sun will set at night, the sun will set at night. The sun may set, but constant love Will shine when he's away, So that dull night is never night, And day is brighter day, So that dull night is never night And day is brighter day, and day is brighter day, brighter day."	0.48363697
The summer gale (John Liptrot Hatton)	"The sum- mer gale, that gently blows, Joys not to meet the balmy rose, As I delight in thee, love! The rosebud opening to the view, Loves not to bathe in morning dew, As I delight, delight in thee. O, thou art all to me, love! All my heart holds dear- ly; Never loved a village swain So truly, so sincerely! O -cerely! So truly, so sincerely! So truly, so sincerely! The bee exults not in the sweets, Enriching ev'ry flower she meets, As I delight in thee, love! The lark rejoices not to rise, At early morn, in cloudless skies, As I delight, delight in thee. O, thou art all to me, love! All my heart holds dear- ly; Never loved a village swain So truly, so sincerely! O -cerely! So truly, so sincerely! So truly, so sincerely!"	0.998341093
The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall (Clara Angela Macirone)	"There was an English ladye bright, The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall; And she would marry a Scottish knight, For love will still be lord of all, For love will still be lord of all, For love will still be lord of all. Her sire gave brooch and jewel fine Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall; Her bro- ther gave but a flask of wine, For ire that love was lord of all, For ire that love was lord of all, For ire that love was lord of all. That wine she had not tasted well, The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall; When dead in her true love's arms she fell, For love was still the lord of all, For love was still the lord of all, For love was still the lord of all. He pierced her brother to the heart, Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall; So perish all would true love part, That love may still be lord of all, That love may still be lord of all, For love may still be lord of all. And then he took the cross divine, Where the sun shines fair on Carlisle wall; And died for her sake in Palestine, So love was still the lord of all, So love was still the lord of all, For love was still the lord of all. Now all ye lovers that faithful prove, The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall; Pray for their souls who died for love, For love shall still be lord of all, For love shall still be Lord of all, For love shall still be lord of all."	0.999791508
The swallows (Christian August Pohlenz)	"Swallows are gayest when evening dews Fill with sweet odours the air, Then we go joyously wheeling about O'er meadows verdant and fair. Earth seem- ing drowsy, on high then we soar; Skies have de- lights still for swal- lows in store, Earth seem- ing drowsy, on high then we soar; Skies have delights still for swallows in store. Fluttering merrily o'er the woods, Lighthearted creatures are we, Pleasures are present in every shape, Pleasures for all who are free.

The sweet Spring (Francis Edward Gladstone)	"Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant king; Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring; Cold doth not sting, the birds do sing, Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing, Puwe, towittawoo, puwe, towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo! The palm and may make country hou- ses gay, Lambs frisk and play, The shepherds pipe all day, And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay, towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo! The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet, Young lovers meet, Old wives asunning sit, In ev'ry street, in ev'ry street, in ev'ry street these tunes our ears do greet, Puwe, towittawoo! Puwe, towittawoo towittawoo, towittawoo, towittawoo, Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant king; Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring; Cold doth not sting, the birds do sing, the birds do sing, the birds, the pretty birds do sing.

The swing (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Under the lofty trees, Where birds in summer sing, In the cool shade, by green leaves made, There hangs the schoolboy's swing. Motionless in the air, Down to the dusty ground, Its ropes hang long, from branches strong, Till playmates gather round, till playmates gather round, gather round, gather round, gather round, gather round, gather round, gather round, till playmates gather round, till playmates gather round, till playmates gather round! Moving slowly, slowly, When merry sports begin, 'Twill faster go, at ev'ry blow, As 'twere a race to win! Faster, higher, higher, The children laugh and shout; The swing beats time, in mystic chime, To all their noisy rout, their noisy rout, their noisy rout, noisy rout, noisy rout, their noisy rout, noisy rout, noisy rout, The swing beats time, in mystic chime, To all their noisy rout, to all their noisy rout! Slowly, slower, slower, As the blows retreat, The swing dies out, at ev'ry shout, Its pulses cease to beat, its pulses cease to beat!"	0.696420917
The triumph of death (C. Holland)	"No longer mourn for me, when I am dead, Than you shall hear the surly sullen bell, the bell Give warning to the world that I am fled From this vile world, in vilest earth to dwell; Nay, if you read this line, remember not The hand that writ it, for I love you so, That I in your sweet thoughts would be for- got. If thinking on me then should make you woe, should make you woe. Oh if, I say, you look upon this verse When I perhaps compounded am with clay, Do not so much as my poor name re- hearse; But let your love e'en with my life decay: Lest the wise world should look in- to your moan, And mock you, mock you! Should mock you with me after I am gone!"	0.105387224
The troubadour (Henry David Leslie)	"Glowing with love on fire for fame, A troubadour that hated sorrow Beneath his lady's window came, And thus he sang his last good- mor- row: ""My arm it is my coun- try's right, My heart is in my true love's bower, Gaily for love and fame to fight Befits a gallant troubadour."" And while he marched with helm on head, And harp in hand the descant rung, As faithful to his fav'rite maid The minstrel burden still he sung: ""My arm it is my coun- try's right, My heart is in my true love's bower, Resolved for love and fame to fight I come a gallant troubadour."" Ev'n when the battle's roar was deep, With dauntless heart he hewed his way, 'Mid splint'ring lance and falchion sweep, And still was heard his warrior lay: ""My arm it is my coun- try's right, My heart is in my true love's bower, For love to die, for fame to fight Becomes the valiant troubadour."" Alas! upon the battlefield He fell beneath a foeman's glaive, But still reclining on his shield, Expiring sung th'exulting strain, ""My life it is my coun- try's right, My heart is in my true love's bower, For love and fame to fall in fight Befits the gallant troubadour, For love and fame to fall in fight Befits the gallant troubadour."""	0.99940081
The two spirits (Ciro Pinsuti)	"There soared a mighty bird in heaven, With ra- pid pinions, strange- ly white; They flashed thro' air like lightning driven Across the starless dome of night. It was the messenger of Fame, of Fame, O'er all the earth a spirit flying, To tell how one to honours came; How died, and left a name undying! And thousands wakened at the story; Their fervid hopes sped up like fire; Some grasped the sword to conquer glory, Some strove to wake the poet's lyre! Some strove to wake the poet's lyre! There sang a merry, plumed chorist, With down- y feathers home- ly gray; And sun- ny plain, and shady forest, In mu- sic echoed back his lay. It was the harbinger of Peace, of Peace, Who told of humble, social blessing, Of patient labours sure increase; Of friendship's joys, of love's caressing. And thousands heard the song enamoured, And flushed with toil grew cheek and brow, As timber groaned, and iron clamoured, And bravely sped the sturdy plough, And bravely sped the sturdy plough."	0.9749769
The village blacksmith (John Liptrot Hatton)	"Under a spreading chestnut tree, The village smithy stands; The smith, a mighty man is he, With large and sinewy hands, And the muscles of his brawny arms Are strong as iron bands. His hair is crisp, and black and long, His face is like the tan; His brow is wet with honest sweat, He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world in the face, For he owes, he owes not any man. Week in, week out, from morn till night, You can hear his bellows blow; You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, With measured beat and slow, Like a sexton ringing the village bell, When the evening sun is low. And children coming home from school, Look in at the open door; They love to see the flaming forge, And hear the bellows roar, And catch the burning sparks that fly Like chaff, like chaff from a threshing floor. He goes on Sunday to the church, And sits among his boys; He hears the parson pray and preach, He hears his daughter's voice, Singing in the villlage choir, And it makes his heart rejoice. It sounds to him like her mother's voice, Singing in Paradise; He needs must think of her once more, How in the grave she lies; And with his hard, rough hand he wipes A tear out of his eyes. Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, Onward through life he goes, Each morning sees some task begun, Each evening sees its close; Something attempted, something done, Has earned a night's repose. Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, For the lesson thou hast taught! Thus, at the flaming forge of life, Our fortunes must be wrought; Thus on its sounding anvil shaped, Each burn- ing deed, each deed and thought."	0.658751738
The village dance (John Liptrot Hatton)	"O, footsteps gaily bounding, Beneath the starry night! Beneath the starry night, With song and laugh resounding, While moonbeams glimmer bright; While moonbeams, moonbeams glimmer bright; And dark eyes softly beaming, With pure and joyous light! With pure and joyous light! And dark eyes softly beaming, With pure and joy- ous light! Young lovers softly speaking, To shy, but willing ears! To shy, but willing ears! These words, like music breaking, She hears, half smiles, half tears; She hears, she hears, half smiles, half tears; ""My true love ne'er forsaking, I'm thine, through changeless years, ""I'm thine, through changeless years; My true love ne'er forsaking, ""I'm thine, through change- less years."" O, sure such simple pleasure Sweet rapture can impart, Sweet rapture can impart, Far more than golden treasure That chills the fondest heart! That chills, that chills the fondest heart! Then quaff joy's brimming measure Ere youth's bright dreams depart! Ere youth's bright dreams depart, Ere youth's bright dreams depart, Ere youth's bright dreams depart."	0.946384798

He thinks on his lady love, he thinks on his lady love, little he heeds The levelling of lances or rushing of steeds, or rush- ing, rush- ing of steeds, He thinks on his true love, and rides in an armour Of proof woven sure by the spells of his charmer. His foot's in the stirrup, his hand's on the mane, He is up and away. How young and how comely, Lo! look on him now, How steadfast his eye, How young and how comely, Lo! look on him now, How steadfast his eye, and how tranquil his brow, The gift of his lady love, the gift of his lady love glitters full gay, As down like the eagle he pours on his prey, he pours, he pours on his prey. Go sing it in song, and tell it in story, He went in his strength and re- turned in his glory. His foot's in the stirrup, his hand's on the mane, He is up and away."	0.993635378
The waterfall (John Liptrot Hatton)	"In summer, calmly gliding down, By lazy brooklets fed; With misty clouds of silver spray Along its rocky bed, Along its rocky bed. Rippling, rippling, Again, it steals a- long, With murmurs seeming scarce to drown The woodbird's joyous song, The woodbird's joyous song, With murmurs scarce to drown The woodbird's joyous song. But winter comes with storm and rain, And silent is the glade; A roaring torrent fills the place, Where late the ripples played, where late the ripples played. And thus my mus- ing ran: The summer brook is childhood's dream, Its flood, the life of man, Its flood, the life of man; The brook is childhood's dream; Its flood the life of man."	0.014622378

The wind (Joseph Barnby)	"Loud and free, loud and free, Loud and free, loud and free; Foaming waves leapt up to meet it, Stately pines bowed down to greet it; While the wail- ing sea, And the forest's mur- mured sigh, Joined the cry, joined the cry, Of the wind that swept o'er land and sea. Tenderly, tenderly, Tenderly, tenderly. But the white rose felt it pass, And the fra- gile stalks of grass Shook with fear to see, All her trembling pe- tals shed, As it fled, as it fled, So gently by, the wind upon the lea. Fierce and free, fierce and free, Fierce and free, fierce and free.

But hark that shout from the guards without, ""Arm ye quick! the Dane, the Dane is nigh."" Each chief starts up from his foaming cup, And ""To battle! on to battle!"" is the Warrior's cry. The min- strels have seized their harps of gold, And they sing such thrill- ing numbers; It seems like the voice of the brave of old, Breaking forth from their place of slumbers: Spear to buckler rang as the minstrels sang, And the Sunburst ban- ner floated wide While rememb'ring the yoke that their fathers broke, ""On for Liberty, for Liberty!"" the Warriors cried."	0.332084788

Though halfway up the hill, Lying beneath me with its sounds and sights... City in the twilight dim and vast, Oh, Oh Ah the cataract of Death; the cataract of Death far thund'ring from the heights. The sea awoke at midnight from its sleep, and 'round the pebbly beaches far and wide I heard the first wave of the rising tide rush onward with uninterrupted sweep: Sea awoke at midnight from its sleep, Ah I heard the first wave of the rising tide rush onward with uninterrupted sweep: A voice out of the silence of the deep, a sound mysteriously multiplied as of a cataract from the mountain side or roar of winds upon a wooded steep. Ah And inaccessible solitudes of being, And inspirations that we deem our own Of things beyond our reason or control. And ye, O living Poets, who are dead 'though ye are living, if neglect can kill: Tell me if in the darkest hours of ill, with drops of anguish falling fast and red from the sharp crown of thorns upon your head, ye were not glad your errand to fulfil? Yes! Yes; for the gift and ministry of Song have something in them so divinely sweet it can assuage the bitterness of wrong.

O patient, patient life! O ten- der strife! The two still sat together there: The red light shone, the red light shone a- bout their knees But all the heads by slow de- grees Had gone and left that lonely pair. O voyage, voyage fast!

Oh, fly, make haste; see, see, she falls Into a pretty slumber; Sing round about her rosy bed, That, waking, she may wonder. Sing to her, 'tis her lover true That sendeth love by you and you; And when you hear her kind reply, Return with pleasant warblings, return with pleasant war- blings, return with pleasant warblings"	0.982085641
