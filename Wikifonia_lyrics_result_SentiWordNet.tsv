It's dark and deserted, but something about it still makes me aware that I care for her yet. Out of the past comes a dim recolection, she's sittin' with me at a table for two; Then in the dark of a window's reflection, I see I'm alone and i know that we're thru. And I go on walkin' with those after hours blues after hours, just the blues and me. I try to find some peace of mind; a friend ly voice, someone who's kind. I close my eyes try not to think, oh, Lord, got ta have a drink, oh, Lord please help me to forget. Oh, Lord, my heart is heavy yet. Oh, Lord, I've got to find a place where I won't see that haunting face. A place where I can go to lose those melancholy after hours blues."	0.366121369

"Bob Dufford, S.J. - Be Not Afraid"	"1.You shall cross the barren desert but you shall not die of thirst. You shall wander far in safety though you do not know the way. You shall speak your words in foreign lands, and all will understan. You shall see the face of God and live. Be not afraid, I go before you always. Come, follow Me, and I will give you rest. 2.If you pass through raging waters in the sea, you shall not drown. If you walk amid the burning flames, you shall not be harmed. If you stand before the pow'r of hell and death is at your side, know that I am with you thru it all. Be not afraid, I go before you always. Come, follow Me, and I will give you rest. 3.Blessed are the poor for the Kingdom shall be theirs. Blest are you that weep and mourn for one day you shall laugh. And if wicked tongues insult and hate you all because of Me, blessed blessed are you! Be not afraid, I go before you always. Come, follow Me, and I will give you rest."	0.02213366

The honey wind blows and the days grow colder; Somehow the world and I have grown just a little bit older; I sit alone where the fire glows, The fire glows, When the honey wind blows, I sit alone and the good Lord knows, I love you so When the honey wind blows."	0.739803768

"George Bruns, Floyd Huddleston - Love"	"Love, it seems like only yesterday, you were just a child at play. Now you're all grown up inside of me. Oh, how fast those moments flee.

George Cates & Mel Levin - Carmen's Boogie	"Hate the op'ra, it's too highbrow; but there's one number I can dig right now. Just like shiftin' without a clutch I ride the boogie with the Carmen touch. You ain't Livin' if you have missed the longhair music with the crewcut twist. Don't love often and don't love much, but love that boogie with the Carmen touch. It rips up floors, it knocks down walls; they tell me it's the reason that Niag'ra falls. It's even made Gibraltar rock; it ain't the kinda thing a mockin' bird can mock. The day it hit in old Bombay, a Hindu couldn't charm a snake away. They say in French, in Greek, and Dutch, the boogie wasn't boogie till it got the Carmen touch. Knew a fellow, a cat named Red; he played fine piano but they shot him dead. Red deserved it, the ""such and such""; he fluffed off boogie with the Carmen touch. What brings saucers around from Mars, and why do Masons leave their Mason jars? What makes babies cry out so much? They want their boogie with the Carmen touch. I can't reveal the way I feel I love so much the Carmen touch."	0.599386009

Lamb - A Bird In A Gilded Cage"	"The ballroom was filled with fashions throng, It shone with a thousand lights And there was a woman who passed along, The fairest of all the sights, A girl to her lover then softly sighed, There's riches at her command, But she married for wealth, not for love he cried, Though she lives in a mansion grand. She's only a bird in a gilded cage, A beautiful sight to see. You may think she's happy and free from care, She's not, though she seems to be, 'Tis sad when you think of her wasted life, For youth can not mate with age, And her beauty was sold, for an old man's gold. She's a bird in a gilded cage."	0.910566825

"Jokern, Carroll Loveday - The Shrine Of Saint Cecilia"	"Our home is a shambles, all I've treasured is gone. The town seems deserted, ev'ry one so forlorn, A storm came from up above, but somehow it missed The Shrine Of Saint Cecilia. The bells in the chapel never ring anymore, The clock in the steeple can't tell time as before, But up on the hillside stands a place heaven blessed, The Shrine Of Saint Cecilia. Each day at even tide when I seek haven from my daily care, You'll find me by her side, it seems so peaceful there. I kneel in my solitude and silently pray, That heav'n will protect you dear, and there'll come a day, The storm will be over and that we'll meet again at The Shrine Of Saint Cecilia."	0.228935349

And then your arms miraculously found me, suddenly the sky turned pale, I could see the midnight sun. Was there such a night, it's a thrill I still don't quite believe, But after you were gone, there was still some stardust on my sleeve.

"Michael Legrand, Alan and Marilyn Bergman - The Windmills Of Your Mind"	"Round like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel, Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel, Like a snowball down a mountain, or a carnival balloon, Like a carousel that's truning running rings around the moon. Like a clock whose hands are sweeping past the minutes of it's face, And the world is like an apple whirling silently in space, Like the circles that you find in the windmills of your mind! Keys that jingle in your pocket, words that jangle in your head, Why did summer go so quickly? Was it something that you said? Lovers walk along a shore and leave their footprints on the sand. Is the sound of distant drumming just the fingers of your hand? Pictures hanging in a hallway and the fragment of a song, Half remembered names and faces, but to whom do they belong? When you knew that it was over you were suddenly aware that the autumn leaves were turning to the color of her hair! Like a circle in a spiral, like a wheel within a wheel, Never ending or beginning on an ever spinning reel, As th images un wind, Like the circles that you find, in the windmills of your mind!"	0.663243642

The words unspoken, well be there soon. For home a song that echoes on, and all who find us will know the tune. Some folk we never forget. Some kind we never forgive. Havent seen the back of us yet, well fight as long as we live. All eyes on the hidden door, to the Lonely Mountain borne. Well ride in the gathering storm until we get our longforgotten gold. We lay under the Misty Mountains cold, in slumbers deep and dreams of gold. We must awake, our lives to make, and in the darkness a torch we hold. From long ago when lanterns burned, until this day our hearts have yearned. Her fate unknown, the Arkenstone, what was stolen must be returned. Oh, oh. We must awake and make the day to find a song for heart and soul. Some folk we never forget. Some kind we never forgive. Havent seen the end of it yet, well fight as long as we live.

Hosanna inthe highest Hosanna to your King! And And And once again the scene was changed New earth there seemed to be I saw the holy city Beside the tideless sea The light of God was on its streets The gates were open wide And all who would might enter And no one was denied No need of moon or stars by night Or sun to shine by day It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away. It was the new Jerusalem that would not pass away. Jerusalem Jerusalem Sing for the night is o'er Hosanna inthe highest Hosanna forever more. Hosanna in the highest Hosanna for ever more"	0.63954396

All of fate's a chance; it's either good or bad. I tossed my coin to say in love with me you'd stay. But all in war's so cold; you either win or los- e.
